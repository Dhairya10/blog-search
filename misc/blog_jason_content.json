    "content": "It took me a while to fully realize the value of something my company achieved years ago, and continues to savor today. It\u2019s one of our greatest quiet advantages, full stop. It\u2019s not something you hear much about in business circles. In fact, I can\u2019t remember the last time I heard anyone spend much time on the topic, or even bring it up in conversation, on a conference stage, or behind a podcast mic. There is, however, lots of discussion about achievement in business. A company can achieve product market fit, operational efficiency, influence, revenue goals, or, ultimately \u2014 and hopefully \u2014 profitability. But I\u2019m not taking about those things. Those are the obvious things, the common talking points. And to those you can add the vanity metrics of achievement \u2014 social media followers, traffic, views, impressions, open rates, press mentions, gross this or gross that. All those are what they are, but they aren\u2019t where it\u2019s at. What I\u2019m talking about is optionality. Achieving optionality is where it\u2019s at. Optionality is a hearty mix of profit margin, small size, independence, attitude, and freedom. You\u2019ve got to have all of it to have optionality. If a board is calling the shots, you don\u2019t have much optionality. If your margins are thin, or non-existent, you don\u2019t have much optionality. If the public owns a piece, you don\u2019t have much optionality. If you rely on investment to pay the bills, you don't have much optionality. If you\u2019re too big to change direction quickly, you don\u2019t have much optionality. And if you\u2019re afraid to speak your mind and stake your point of view, you don\u2019t have much optionality. Optionality lets you do things no one would give you permission to do. It lets you write excellent software and give it away for free if you choose. It lets you do things that don\u2019t make sense in the current climate, but will long-term. It lets you be early while eventually catches up. Optionality is ecstasy. It\u2019s making it up as you go, without making excuses. It\u2019s openly changing your mind without having to save face. Optionality is equanimity, the corporate equivalent of enlightenment. So, entrepreneurs, ditch the bullshit. Abandon growth-at-all-costs. Reject conventional metrics. Scorn hollow acceptance. Instead, hunt for optionality. It's freedom. It's power. It's everything you crave, wrapped in a single, potent package. Chase it relentlessly. And when you get it, don\u2019t let go. It\u2019s not something you hear much about in business circles.

    "title": "Directional Decisions in Product Development: The Case of Writebook",
    "content": "In the course of building products, you\u2019ll make a thousand common decisions, but only a handful of directional decisions. While a common decision may alter a specific feature, design, or implementation, a directional decision remaps the fundamental trajectory of the entire product. Make a directional decision and you\u2019re now pointed this way or that way. Make a directional decision and you either shut something off or open something up. Make a directional decision and you\u2019ll get a hundred no\u2019s for the price of one. Let\u2019s look at a specific directional decision we made for Writebook, our latest product. Writebook is remarkably simple software that lets you publish text and pictures in a simple, browsable online book format. Books are written and published. This presents an opportunity to make a directional decision: Is Writebook a writing tool or a publishing tool? Or both? At one point, we treated the publishing side and the writing side as equals. Both are involved in getting a book online. Seems reasonable, right? Reasonable isn\u2019t the measure, though. It\u2019s easy to say something should do everything well because saying something is easy doesn\u2019t involve any work, or require any tradeoffs. But building products is all about tradeoffs. When there are no tradeoffs in the conversation you\u2019re having, you know you aren\u2019t building, you\u2019re just talking. But it was time to build. But what\u2019s the epicenter of Writebook? What\u2019s the thing you can do easily with Writebook that was a lot harder without Writebook? Essentially, what does Writebook exist to do? What did the current world look like without Writebook? You can write books in a thousand tools in a thousand places. But instantly publishing a book in a simple web-friendly format is really hard. It generally involves a lot of custom work, or a complex CMS system, or bending some blogging platform into a pretzel just to unsatisfyingly make it sorta kinda create books instead of blogs. And since Writebook supports Markdown, you can easily write in a simple text editor and then copy and paste the finished text into Writebook when you\u2019re ready. The place to write isn\u2019t what\u2019s lacking out there. The place to publish is. So we made a directional decision: Writebook was a publishing tool. You could obviously still write in it \u2014 we even designed a new Markdown editor to make basic formatting easier. But, our overall directional deciding Writebook was about publishing rather than writing allowed us to say no to dozens of days of additional work and sidestep piles of additional complexity. But how did that decision come to be? Why did it happen? When did it happen? Well, before we settled on the publishing angle, we went down the \u201cwriting and publishing are equals\u201d path. Part of that project involved building a system to track diffs so an author (or multiple) could track changes, additions, and subtractions. Writing software usually has this sort of thing, so if we were making writing software it felt like basic table stakes. It was during a design review that it hit me. This is fucking complicated and unnecessary. It\u2019ll work, but it\u2019s not actually useful. And, further, trying to build a multiple-author change tracking system to our standards is going to distract us from the more important, core differentiation work we have to do on the publishing side. Workbook is a final publishing platform, it's not a collaborative editing environment. What we're solving for is easily getting a book up online, in in various formats, in the simplest, quickest, more comprehensive way. If you want comprehensive collaborative editing and change tracking, write it elsewhere and, when it's done, pop it in here to publish. We ended up keeping a very minimal version of writing history in place as a backstop for major mistakes (\u201cOh shit, I deleted the whole thing by accident\u201d), but in the final version of Writebook there\u2019s no formal track changes feature, no colored diffs, and no focus on the collaborative writing process. Writebook is simply a final publishing platform first and foremost. You can write and edit in it, but it\u2019s bare bones and basic \u2014 which is fine almost all of the time anyway. And guess what? Writebook has been out for a few weeks now and tracking changes or sophisticated collaborative editing tools or features has barely been requested. I\u2019m glad we explored it early on, but even more glad we dropped it in the end. Publishing was the right direction. -Jason About Jason Fried Hey!

But it's surprisingly challenging to publish books on the web in nice, cohesive, tight, easy-to-navigate HTML format. A collection of 20 essays can be a book. Or a company's handbook can be a book. Or an actual book like Shape Up can be a book. But usually you have to make a custom web site, or stretch to use a blog publishing/CMS tool to kinda-sorta squish separate posts together into a packaged whole. It's really not ideal. We know \u2014 we've published a variety of books online, and we've had to go the custom route each time. Having to go the custom route for something that should be fundamentally simple is a red flag. And an opportunity. It really shouldn't be this hard. So we did something about it. Introducing Writebook. It's a dead simple platform to publish web-based books. They have covers, they can have title pages, they can have picture pages, and they can have text pages. Each book gets its own URL, and navigating and keeping track of your progress is all built right in. Writebook isn't a service \u2014 it's software you download and install on your own server. We've made it incredibly easy to get going \u2014 it just takes a few minutes. Even non-technical folks can get it all set up. We'll email you a single command you paste into a terminal and it takes care of the rest. No maintenance required either, it takes care of itself, auto-updates, etc. Writebook also comes with all the Rails code so you can see how it's built, modify it for your own use, and learn how applications like this are made. And how much for all this? Absolutely nothing. Writebook is FREE. Writebook is our love letter to truly independent, zero-cost web publishing on the open web. No gatekeepers, no publisher required.

    "content": "There\u2019s no reason to think about things that didn\u2019t work out as failures. Yet, it\u2019s especially pervasive in entrepreneurial circles. It\u2019s almost as if failure has been fetishized. Nearly worshipped as a right of passage, a prerequisite, a required step on the way. I\u2019m not here to say everything works out. Most things don\u2019t. Plenty of things I\u2019ve poured time and attention into never went anywhere. It can be disappointing. And, depending on what went into it, and what you're left with, it can put you in a perilous spot. But, for your own good, it\u2019s best to relativize things like this \u2014 especially when the odds are perpetually, and naturally, stacked against you. Collecting losses, and becoming a connoisseur of catastrophe, won\u2019t help you get a win next time around. So, what instead? For me, it\u2019s a simple shift. I\u2019ve always just felt that some stuff works out better than other stuff. I think that\u2019s the healthiest way to think about it. Just a drop of relative recognition is all it deserves. I also don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find that many lessons looking back on what didn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t really know why it didn\u2019t work anyway. It feels good to imagine you do, but there isn\u2019t a long history of people doing the same thing again, swapping this one wrong thing for another presumed right thing, and turning it all around. But if it was so easy to see what went wrong on reflection, shouldn\u2019t there be turnaround stories everywhere you look? More likely, it a swirling confluence of decisions, ideas, events, timing, conditions, and serendipity that drove it off the map. It\u2019s easy to reflect comfortably on convenient assumptions about the past, but real reasons happen in present conditions. So yeah, some stuff works out better than others. That means some stuff doesn\u2019t work at all. But it\u2019s not a failure, and it doesn\u2019t need a name. It just didn\u2019t pan out as you hoped. Move on, look forward, learn by doing and not reviewing, and get on with it. Next time isn\u2019t that time again, it\u2019s a time that never happened before.",

    "title": "A Better Path Forward",
    "content": "One of the reasons companies have a hard time moving forward is because they've tangled themselves in the near past. Eyes aimed backwards rather than ahead, staring at the dark, feet in their own concrete. They've trapped themselves looking for certainty where there isn't any. Searching for actionable advice where there are only guesses. Something sorta went wrong. A project didn't go as planned. Some launch didn't meet expectations. A number someone felt was in reach didn't get hit. So they look back, scanning the ruins for something shiny. They gather people up and call for a search party. They launch into post-mortems and retrospectives. It's a mistake most of the time. And a waste of time almost all of the time. Let's start with when it makes sense. If the process is highly mechanized, isolated, or systematized, then you can look back and find the exact moment when something went wrong. And you don't need to conjure up a \"what if\" counterfactual, you know for sure this was the point of failure. For example, if you're making widgets, and your small circular disks are coming out as half moons instead, then you can trace the process back, figure out where the stamping went wrong, correct that machine or process, and absolutely 100% fix the issue. If you can do that, by all means do that. Technical downtime can often be perfectly traced like that, too. But so many failed projects subject to retrospectives are searching for reasons where there are only humans to be found. Ever been on one that lasts hours only to determine \"next time we need to communicate better\"? I bet you have. Or one that says \"If we only would have involved QA earlier we would have caught that.\" Or \"Next time we need to be more careful to take seasonal timing into account\". Or \"designers and programmers need to work more closely together.\" Or some other generalized platitude, extruded from the retrospective process. There may be truth in the statements, but are they really the reason things didn't go as planned? Really? You sure? And those aren't actually answers, they remain questions without question marks. So now what, specifically? Spending hours of people's time grabbing for something grippy in the box of generalized excuses isn't going to turn up a treasure. And most of the time, reasons are actually mysteries. Or deeper than you can dig. Or too many to count. The world, the work, the market, the customer, the timing, the pressure, the economy at large, the expectations, the hopes and dreams are fuzzy, abstract, and irrational. You can point, but not at a point that's clearly defined enough to make a difference next time. Counterfactuals are deeply satisfying because they can never be proven. They never have to smash into reality. Imagination takes hold, a scapegoat comes into focus, and we can blame it all on the thing we'll never know mattered in the first place. Report written, meeting adjourned! A better path is to reflect forward, not backwards. Develop a loose theory while working on what's next. Appreciate there's no certainty to be found, and put all your energy into doing better on an upcoming project. But how will you do better next time if you don't know what went wrong last time? Nothing is guaranteed other than experience. You'll simply have more time under the curve, and more moments under tension, to perform better moving forward. Internalize as you go, not as you went. If you're any good, you'll simply do better next time because you're better at what you do than you were the last time you did it. That may be murky and unsatisfying for some, but I believe it to be absolutely true. So next time the involuntary instinct kicks in, and the urge to schedule a retro when something didn't go as planned, skip it and skip ahead. There's more to learn looking forward. -Jason",

Roger\u2019s workshop is on the Isle of Man \u2014 far away from the heart of the industry in Switzerland. In fact, he\u2019s the only watchmaker on the Isle of Man, and one of very few in the UK. He thinks being far away is a good thing. I love how he puts it: \u201cThe influences just aren\u2019t around, and I can just get on with my days work and just make what I want to make.\u201d -Roger W. Smith I love that notion \u2014 it\u2019s one I\u2019ve tried to hold dear myself. Don\u2019t be influenced too much. Be aware of what\u2019s great, but don\u2019t get other people\u2019s work too deep in your head or you\u2019ll be doing their work, not yours. That kind of influence isn't really an influence, it's a trap. It\u2019s so easy to get sucked into other people\u2019s work. Following industry news, attending every conference you can, picking brains. But I\u2019ve often found it better to retreat into your own mind and bring something original. The more you see how other people do what they do, the harder it becomes to do things differently. So pay attention a little, but not too much \u2014 leave more room for your own ideas than for theirs. -Jason",

    "content": "I\u2019ve written about [the class I\u2019d like to teach](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-writing-class-id-like-to-teach-11b259f44a5d), but what I\u2019ve been thinking about lately is the class I\u2019d like to attend. Not necessarily now, but when I was growing up. In the 6th grade, let\u2019s say.I don\u2019t know why people ask me this, but I\u2019m often polled for my opinion on the American education system. What\u2019s my take? What would I do to fix it? I don\u2019t know, really. \u201cIt\u201d covers too much ground to be addressed accurately. Education is delivered at every scale, from an individual reading a book, to a 1:1 tutor, to a small home/classroom setting, to a larger university auditorium-sized class, to online classes that can be theoretically taken by the entire planet at once. From one to 8 billion. You can\u2019t fix anything that\u2019s so big and so varied. You can, however, fix small parts of things. And hopefully, as the small, fixed parts add up, you have a chance at chipping away at a big problem. So here\u2019s my one small idea: I\u2019d begin to teach *iteration*. Iteration as a subject, equivalient to math, science, history, language, art, music, etc. How do you make something better over time? How do you return to something that you\u2019ve done and see it with fresh eyes? How do you apply new perspective to an old problem? Where do you find that new perspective? What trails do you follow and which do you ignore? How do you smash the familiar and reassemble something new from the same pieces?Once you\u2019re done with school, and cast out into the world, your job is likely to involve iteration. No matter what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re probably going to have to do something over. And often times again and again. You rarely simply deliver something and move on. You\u2019re asked to refactor, to build on it, to \u201cmake it better\u201d. Making anything better is iteration. When you put something out there, it\u2019ll often land right back in your lap. Sometimes that feedback boomerangs back directly, other times you have to infer the problems by disciphering other people\u2019s behavior when they interact with the thing you gave them. This customer struggled with this, this manufacturing tolerance didn\u2019t line up with that, this printing process looked better on the screen than it did on paper. Or after a certain amount of time passes while working on something, you reflect on what you\u2019ve done and don\u2019t like the reflection. Either way, someone\u2019s probably going to ask you to take the state of *your*art, and make it the state of*the*art.Now that you\u2019ve got it back, what do you do with it? This is something you have to learn how to deal with. But in school \u2014 save for writing a few drafts before handing in the final version \u2014 you don\u2019t get to iterate much. You move on from assignment to assignment, rarely getting a chance to revisit your work earlier in the semester. I think that\u2019s a missed opportunity. So, perhaps for a final assignment (no matter the subject), students should be able to choose something they did earlier in the year and get a chance to improve on it. Make version 2. I think working on four things, and getting a chance to redo one of them would be more valuable than working on five separate things. It would be a better education. Or another take would be a single assignment for the entire semester. Every two weeks you hand in a new version of it. In time you may slam into diminishing returns, but that\u2019s all part of it too. That would be a better education. Or maybe you work on something and hand it in. Then the teacher shuffles the deck, so to speak, and hands you back someone else\u2019s assignment. Now you have two weeks to improve on that. And that cycle \u2014 improving on someone else\u2019s work \u2014 continues for the whole semester. That would closely mirror what work on the outside is really like. That would be a better education. I don\u2019t know, something like that. So there, I guess that\u2019s my initial idea to improve the educational system. Teach problem solving through iteration. Bounce things back to people for a second or third try. And then a fourth and a fifth. And so on. Require them to bring new perspectives. Demonstrate how time, space, and chance are on your side \u2014 they give you the opportunity to wander around with an idea and take it in new directions. Iteration is evolution. Hopefully what\u2019s next is better than what came before it. -Jason",

    "title": "Keeping easy from becoming hard",
    "content": "We're changing the name of a tool that exists in millions of existing projects. That could require a migration, which would require especially careful testing and staging ahead of a major deploy. The other sticking point is that Basecamp allows each customer to rename their tools inside a project, or even the default set of tools applied to all projects. So it's possible that some of their Campfire's were renamed to other things like 'Group chat' or 'Chatter' or 'Talk' or 'The Watercooler' or whatever else felt natural to them. So not every Campfire is called Campfire. The hard thing to do would be to automate the process by going through every project and changing any Campfires named exactly 'Campfire' to 'Chat' instead, and then leaving the rest as is. But we also have foreign language conditions \u2014 someone may have named their Campfire 'Fogata' (which is Campfire in Spanish). Do we change those too? If we're out to be accurate and consistent yes. But no. We don't do any of that. Doing that would be hard. And unnecessary. And time consuming. And potentially error prone. All sorts of things could go wrong \u2014 or right \u2014 but whatever the outcome, it's entirely unnecessary work to begin with. So we won't do it. We'll simply do this: Moving forward, all new projects have their chat tool called Chat, and all existing projects stay exactly as they were, whatever they were. Consistency is not important here, context is. Let old things be, let new things be different. This sidesteps the extra work, extra testing, conversion complications, and potential for errors. Does that mean some older projects will have Campfires while some newer projects will have Chats? Even on the same account? Sure does. And that's just fine. It doesn't matter, and in time it'll fade away anyway as more new projects are created than old projects exist. Don't make easy things hard.",

    "content": "There's nothing complicated about company culture. Culture simply happens. It's emergent behavior. There's nothing to do, it just is. A company's culture is a 50-day moving average. It's what you've been collectively doing as a company over the last 50 days. How do you treat people? Who have you hired (or fired) and why? What do you when people are stressed out? How do you help people? How do you critique each other? How do you share? How do you help people who are stuck? Where's the bar on quality? How do you support customers? How do you close deals? What have you let go on too long? What have you celebrated? What have you let slide? How honest have you been with each other and yourself. It's all that and a zillion other things. But it's all stuff that actually happened, it's not lists of things you wish had happened, or declared would happen in some ideal setting. Much of it is interpersonal, expressed both inside and outside the organization. Why 50 days? It's enough time for patterns to emerge, yet malleable enough to be current and honest. One day, or even a couple weeks, isn't enough to stand for culture. A series of moments tied together loosely by near-term time just isn't enough to establish what it's really like somewhere. We can all be on our best behavior for a little while, but the longer while tells the truth. Culture is the non-fiction story of an organization. It writes itself. -Jason",

    "content": "Way back when we launched the first version of Basecamp in 2004, we ran all our credit card charges through a merchant account provided by JP Morgan Chase. Charging credit cards wasn't easy in the early 2000s. This was back when being an 'internet company' was a major red flag. The process required mounds of paperwork, proof, and business model scrutiny just to get approved. Barely capable, ancient APIs sorta kinda let you hook into internal systems. Charging a card successfully felt like a miracle. You had no idea. It wasn't years later until companies like Stripe made it simple. While you were never really happy with the service, you had to have it. And switching to another service meant going through the whole ungainly process again. And the grass was probably browner. However, one day a fellow named Bryan Johnson reached out. He started a company called Braintree that processed credit cards. I can't remember exactly what made them different, although they certainly felt more 'modern'. Their API looked like it had been written recently, rather than back in the 80s like JP Morgan's. But more than that, we liked Bryan. He was clearly competent, he was local, he wasn't afraid of the internet, he was aware of what we did, what we were trying to do, and who we were. He wasn't a sales guy trying to close a deal, he was a CEO trying to build his own business. That meant something to us. So we gave them our business. And nearly two decades later, we're still with them today. And Bryan didn't just close the deal and move on, he remained our point of contact for years. He was always reasonably available, and would always be willing to dig into an issue if something went wrong. We had his direct cell and his email. He felt like he was on our side. This whole experience made a major impression on me. It made me really appreciate who we did business with. And even in my personal life, who I do business with. Can I reach the owner? Can I email the CEO? Who's over there working for me, vs. just selling me and moving on? This is one of the reasons I really value doing business with smaller businesses. Typically founder-led, or owner-involved companies. Companies that may have structure, but they'll part it like the Red Sea when a customer needs access to the top. It's also why I make sure I'm accessible to all our customers. I even include my email address \u2014 work and personal \u2014 in different places when new customers sign up.

How much should you worry about Essentially, lots of Of course you exist in a market with multiple options, but that's not your real competition. Your real competition are your costs. Yours, not theirs. You, not them. You ultimately stay in business when you make more money than you spend. The amount you make depends on a number of factors, many surprisingly far outside your control. But one of the few controls you have in business is cost control. Bills don't materialize \u2014 you amass costs, you put yourself on the hook. Whether it's hiring and salaries, software and subscriptions, infrastructure and hardware, office space or not, marketing/advertising or not. The market may determine the prices, but you determine the costs. What are you willing to pay for, and how much, is your call, no one else's.

It doesn't matter what Asana (or Monday, or Click Up, or any other company in our space) is doing. We're doing what we need to do to win against losing. We're running a stable business our customers can count on, improving our product for those customers every few weeks, and maintaining a long-term track record of corporate health. Or take Bottom line: Make your own business work. It doesn't matter what everyone else is doing. Of course your position in the market, and the perception of your brand, influences customers' purchasing decisions. And of course you need to be in the arena to compete, so you can earn customers who provide your revenue. But you can give yourself a better chance by staying small, keeping costs in check, and building a larger margin buffer. The lower your costs, the fewer customers you need to come out ahead. More heads down, less looking around. The competition is your spending. How much should you worry about *them*, what you can do to beat*them*, how much should you pay attention to what*they're*doing, how you should respond when*they*release or say something new, what you should say when a customer compares you to*them*, etc.Essentially, lots of *they's*and*them's*.Of course you exist in a market with multiple options, but that's not your real competition. Your real competition are your costs. Yours, not theirs. You, not them. You ultimately stay in business when you make more money than you spend. The amount you make depends on a number of factors, many surprisingly far outside your control. But one of the few controls you have in business is cost control. Bills don't materialize \u2014 you amass costs, you put yourself on the hook. Whether it's hiring and salaries, software and subscriptions, infrastructure and hardware, office space or not, marketing/advertising or not. The market may determine the prices, but you determine the costs. What are you willing to pay for, and how much, is your call, no one else's. Make your economics work, and you're going to stay in business, no matter what *they*are doing.This is why the number of customers you have, and your market share, doesn't really matter when it's compared to another company's market share or customer count. Take Asana. It would be fair to say Basecamp competes with Asana, in a traditional sense. But in 2021 they lost $285,000,000. In 2020 they lost $210,000,000. And in 2019 they lost $118,000,000. And they're on track to lose even more with over $370,000,000 in losses booked for the trailing twelve months. That's closing in on a billion dollars in losses over the last four years. [Check the numbers for yourself.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASAN/financials?p=ASAN&guccounter;=1&guce;_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93b3JsZC5oZXkuY29tLw&guce;_referrer_sig=AQAAAH1I1TIUYUuPS3MigaAZy9MZDwP4BEyyyu2fFqt_cnHJ3oYUzvXV79VIoR0BnGgk2bth8L24QUGN_0A-Ve_UFxaSfLm3RQe_tF8IQD_osHXBMdVhoC40N9iE_oKULfDkSZQNoCLGrb_I1bBu1aNaL8jJpsDdHQZlQpi5tq8R7YFA)You may have seen their ads in the airport, sponsored posts in your Linked In feed, or their logo front and center at a conference, so it would be easy to say they're \"winning\". We aren't in the airport, we aren't buying ads on Linked In, and we aren't sponsoring conferences. You so you might say we're losing. Except that we're profitable. In the competition against our costs, we're coming out ahead. We have enough to run a successful business and serve our employees and customers well. It doesn't matter what Asana (or Monday, or Click Up, or any other company in our space) is doing. We're doing what we need to do to win against losing. We're running a stable business our customers can count on, improving our product for those customers every few weeks, and maintaining a long-term track record of corporate health. Or take [HEY](https://hey.com). HEY has tens of thousands of paying customers. For us that's a win. For Google/Gmail it would be a huge failure. They need a whole lot more to make something worth it. We need a whole lot less to make it a spectacular success. HEY has tens of thousands of users. Gmail has a billion. So are we \"losing\" to Gmail? Or are HEY and Gmail both doing great, given their respective positions and requirements? The latter.Bottom line: Make your own business work. It doesn't matter what everyone else is doing. Of course your position in the market, and the perception of your brand, influences customers' purchasing decisions. And of course you need to be in the arena to compete, so you can earn customers who provide your revenue.

    "content": "Look around in the tools you use. Especially project management tools. You'll likely find the products proudly displaying the percentage of this or that that's been completed. This project is 73% done. This task list is 57% done. This process is 42% complete. It's almost certainly wrong. A lie would be more accurate. Most of these percentages are attempting to measure work. But work isn't a vote \u2014 it's not either for this candidate or for that one. 62% voted for Candidate A is a fair assessment, but \"This to-do list is 62% complete\" is not. It may represent the percentage of items checked off vs. not checked off, but it doesn't represent the reality of what remains whatsoever. Why's that? Because a number can't represent the position of a project, or a piece of work. There's easier work, there's harder work, there's known work, there's unknown work. What does 62% done mean when the \"remaining\" 38% of the work is twice as hard as the initial 62%? Everything that's already done could have been done in a week, but the remaining 38% could take two months. If you do the easy stuff first, and leave the hard, or unknown stuff to the end, 62% done isn't just misleading, it's malpractice. Numbers like these take the true texture of a project and flatten them like an iron into a false linear representation of progress. You can blame the tools for this. People think they tools they use don't matter. That they're all roughly the same. They aren't. Not even close. Tools leave an imprint on your process. They cut a deep groove in your organization. They form a scab that may take years of healing to clear up. They give you a number so you run with it. In your presentation, in your reports, in your promises. They don't have to live with the consequences \u2014 they're just tools. But you aren't. You're the responsible party. Don't depend on the undependable. Take your tools seriously. You become what they make you. Which means they can help make you and your team even better if you pick the right ones. (PS, this is why we developed Hill Charts in Basecamp.

    "content": "Since the beginning of Basecamp, we\u2019ve been loath to make promises about future product improvements. We\u2019ve always wanted customers to judge the product they could buy and use today, not some imaginary version that might exist in the future. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve never committed to a product road map. It\u2019s not because we have a secret one in the back of some smoky room we don\u2019t want to share, but because one doesn\u2019t actually exist. We honestly don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll be working on in a year, so why act like we do? But when we recently launched an See, a new version didn\u2019t initially include a feature our customers were clamoring for: Project templates. The requests piled in, the emails piled up. We wanted to do it, but we weren\u2019t sure when we\u2019d be able to get to it. So we just told people \u201cby the end of the year.\u201d At the time that gave us eight months or so\u2014which sounded easy\u2014but it discounted all the work it would take to get it done as well as all the other stuff we also had to do at the same time. March ticked by. Then April. Then May, June, July, and August. We still hadn\u2019t started on the project templates feature. And then September and October arrived, and now, to come through on our promise, we had to drop a bunch of other things we wanted to do so that we could deliver project templates before the year ended. It was a great feature, and customers ultimately loved it, but we had to rush it. That\u2019s what promises lead to\u2014rushing, dropping, scrambling, and a tinge of regret at the earlier promise that was a bit too easy to make. Promises pile up like debt, and they accrue interest, too. The longer you wait to fulfill them, the more they cost to pay off and the worse the regret. When it\u2019s time to do the work, you realize just how expensive that yes really was. Many companies are weighed down by all sorts of prior obligations to placate.

If advice on how to run your company isn't coming at you 280 characters at a time on Twitter, you can hear it on a podcast, read it on a Substack, or get it right here on your LinkedIn feed. There's hardly a CEO, an entrepreneur, or a cultural figure these days who doesn't profess to hold some wisdom that will lead you to building a great business. I don't think this proliferation of expertise is a particularly useful development. It's overwhelming and often contradicting. It's hard to know what's worth knowing when you don't know in the first place. So rather than give you advice on how to take advice, I thought I'd share my personal approach to filtering it. Whenever I get advice, I first find out if the person giving it has ever done the thing being suggested. There are plenty of gurus out there telling you how to start a business who have never started one themselves, like business school professors who have spent their careers in academia. Or marketing experts that haven't marketed anything at scale for a decade (or ever). Or ChatGPT experts telling you how game changing something is when the game barely started. If they haven't done the thing, I dismiss the advice. I don't want theory. I want practice. If they have done the thing, then I find out when they did it. Was it years ago? Are they still doing it as they describe? I believe advice has an expiration date. For example, I'm the wrong person to ask about starting a business. Why? I haven't started one for 24 years. You're far better off asking someone who started a business six months ago. Then, if they have done it, and they still are doing it, it's good to know for how long. I put more weight into someone's advice if that person has been following it for an extended time. Another thing I consider is the motivation behind the advice. Is someone with experience trying to sell you something? If so, discount that advice. If it's in the service of sharing and mentoring, and there's no commercial connection, invest in that advice. Last, I tend to look at how much advice a person gives. If someone is a professional advice giver \u2014 writing book after book in quick succession \u2014 I'll take what they have to say with a grain of salt. It's hard to be good at one thing, let alone dozens of things. Here's the most important thing to recognize about advice: It's relative. It's contextual. People love to share success stories, and suggest you follow in their footsteps, but most people really have no idea how they achieved what they achieved. They look back and connect dots that maybe weren't there, lay it out for you, and encourage you to do the same thing. That's why you should ignore more advice than you take. Find your own way. Then, once you've been doing it long enough, maybe you can share your lessons with others \u2014 and they can decide whether that's worth listening to.

    "title": "Avoiding Overkill in Business",
    "content": "Business is often seen as the art of acquisition. Acquiring talent, customers, revenue, profits, mindshare, marketshare. Building and growing requires consumption, addition, parlaying some of this into a lot of that. But the smartest businesses \u2014 the ones that tend to stick around for the long haul \u2014 know that existence is also about avoidance. Avoiding careening variable costs, avoiding getting involved with things that aren't core to your business, avoiding spending time on things that don't matter, avoiding bad investments, avoiding people who don't help you prosper, and even avoiding customers who aren't the right fit. However, there's something even more fundamental to avoid. It would be easy to call it 'complexity' but that's not quite it. Complexity can be necessary, and intricacy can be quite beautiful \u2014 just stare into a Moorish mosaic and you'll know it. So complexity isn't the issue. Overkill is the issue. Avoiding overkill is the real cheat code. That's how you jump levels. It's how you make a lot more progress with a lot less effort. Overkill is the dust that settles on the stuff that took a lot of energy to build or buy, but turned out not to be necessary. The over-engineered, over-designed, over-hired, over-litigated, the over-spent, over-promised, over-deliberated. Overkill is the policy that was written but never enacted. The technology that was purchased that was never used. The seven steps that could be handled in two. The nine people in a meeting made for three. The business equivalent of the 12 bedroom house for a family of four. The cooks when you don't even have a kitchen. Overkill is using five different products to run a single project. Overkill is an seven-stage interview process that exhausts everyone involved. Overkill is acting like a company 100x your size. Overkill is buying what they bought but that you don't need. Overkill is paying thousands for something worth hundreds. Overkill is hoping that losing more will turn into a win. In our 24 years, there's nothing we've tried to avoid more at 37signals than overkill. In the things we do, in the way we work, in the things we buy, in the things we use. And, especially, in the products we make for our ourselves and our customers. Basecamp and HEY are built to do what they need to do, in the most straightforward, elegant, and enjoyable way, and nothing more. So you can avoid overkill too. Every day is an opportunity to find just right. To toss that policy that's in the way. To slim down the stack. To sharpen things up. To eliminate the work that doesn't need to be done. To polish the scratched glass so you can see through again. Amass what you need, but ignore even more. Kill overkill. But the smartest businesses \u2014 the ones that tend to stick around for the long haul \u2014 know that existence is also about avoidance. Avoiding careening variable costs, avoiding getting involved with things that aren't core to your business, avoiding spending time on things that don't matter, avoiding bad investments, avoiding people who don't help you prosper, and even avoiding customers who aren't the right fit. However, there's something even more fundamental to avoid. It would be easy to call it 'complexity' but that's not quite it. Complexity can be necessary, and intricacy can be quite beautiful \u2014 just stare into a Moorish mosaic and you'll know it. So complexity isn't the issue. Overkill is the issue. Avoiding overkill is the real cheat code. That's how you jump levels. It's how you make a lot more progress with a lot less effort. Overkill is the dust that settles on the stuff that took a lot of energy to build or buy, but turned out not to be necessary. The over-engineered, over-designed, over-hired, over-litigated, the over-spent, over-promised, over-deliberated. Overkill is the policy that was written but never enacted. The technology that was purchased that was never used. The seven steps that could be handled in two. The nine people in a meeting made for three. The business equivalent of the 12 bedroom house for a family of four. The cooks when you don't even have a kitchen. Overkill is using five different products to run a single project. Overkill is an seven-stage interview process that exhausts everyone involved. Overkill is acting like a company 100x your size. Overkill is buying what they bought but that you don't need. Overkill is paying thousands for something worth hundreds. Overkill is hoping that losing more will turn into a win. In our 24 years, there's nothing we've tried to avoid more at 37signals than overkill. In the things we do, in the way we work, in the things we buy, in the things we use. And, especially, in the products we make for our ourselves and our customers. Basecamp and HEY are built to do what they need to do, in the most straightforward, elegant, and enjoyable way, and nothing more. So you can avoid overkill too. Every day is an opportunity to find just right. To toss that policy that's in the way. To slim down the stack. To sharpen things up. To eliminate the work that doesn't need to be done. To polish the scratched glass so you can see through again. Amass what you need, but ignore even more. Kill overkill. -Jason",

    "content": "In the past I\u2019m far from perfect, and I still occasionally catch myself doing this today, but far less frequently. And when I do it, I spot it and correct for it. I\u2019d say I\u2019m 90% better. Lately I\u2019ve been using another tool to help create some space before I form an opinion. It\u2019s a simple word called \u201cyet\u201d. Over the past years I\u2019ve found a lot of joy in things I\u2019d normally have dismissed. And it\u2019s all because of \u201cyet\u201d. Instead of \u201cI don\u2019t like that color\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t like that color\u2026 yet\u201d. Instead of I don\u2019t like that taste, it\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t like that taste\u2026 yet\u201d. I still may ultimately decide I don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t prefer it, or don\u2019t want it, but There are so many things I\u2019ve ended up loving, appreciating, and savoring that I would have previously rejected impulsively. What I\u2019ve found is obvious: You don\u2019t need to have an opinion on everything. Instead, just be open. Let it settle in. Get used to it. Give it a chance. And then you\u2019ll know. Or not! It\u2019s ok not to know where you stand on something. It\u2019s actually a lot more interesting. There\u2019s so much freedom in not having an opinion yet (or ever). Minds are expected to be made up these days. In a flash, no less. No thanks. I\u2019ll just let it roll around for a while with no deadline. There\u2019s no rush, and very little benefit to rush to judgement. You just might find, as I have, that there\u2019s a lot more to like and discover and revel in when you simply allow yourself to wait. Bask in the maybe for a while. This is different than indecision. When decisions do need to be made, I make them. But many things in life don\u2019t need decisions \u2014 they\u2019re just experiences. And having more experience with something, rather than less, is a great way to get to know the depth and wonder inherent in the things we\u2019re often quick to push away.",

    "title": "The Second Hire: A Crucial Moment in Hiring",
    "content": "Out of all things I\u2019m asked about, hiring tops the list. From the actual hiring process, to reviews, to motivation and retention strategies, curiosity about hiring is on full charge. There\u2019s a lot to cover, but I\u2019d like to share some thoughts about a moment that doesn\u2019t get enough attention: The end of the first year and the beginning of the second. Hiring is typically thought of as something you do once per person. Once someone\u2019s hired, training, growing, and retaining are the next things you do. You may keep training someone, you may keep growing someone, you may keep promoting someone, but you surely don\u2019t keep hiring someone. It\u2019s on that point I disagree. I\u2019ve found that, actually, you hire someone at least twice. You hire someone initially, and then, if all goes well, you hire them again 12 months later. That second hire is the crucial hire, even though it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say you continually hire someone throughout their career. Framing it like this simplifies a lot. And the simplification isn\u2019t for convenience, it\u2019s for clarity. Deep, cutting, crystal clarity. Yes, managers and team leads here check in with people as they get going, 90 days in, 6 months in, and as-needed 1:1s along the way. And since leadership here is very hands on, everyone collides with each other\u2019s work. At 37signals, it\u2019s actually easier to know how someone\u2019s doing than not. And it\u2019s in that first year \u2014 really those first few months \u2014 where you can tell if someone\u2019s going to work out, or we\u2019re just not right for them. This is where the magic of the second hire framing comes in. Rather than go through an extensive, artificial 12-month performance analysis process to statistically determine how someone\u2019s doing at the end of that crucial first year, we blow all that abstract blurriness away with one simple clarifying question. The manager simply asks themselves: \u201cWith a full year behind me, knowing what I know now, would I hire this person again?\u201d Because that\u2019s essentially exactly what you\u2019re doing. If you keep the person on, you\u2019re re-hiring them. Because the alternative is letting them go and hiring someone else to replace them. So you are hiring either way. So just get real about it and dive into the deliberation head first. I can\u2019t stress enough how clarifying this is. With a single insight you\u2019ve answered a dozen questions and eliminated a dozen more. Plus it annihilates all sorts of procedural acrobatics companies typically use to measure someone\u2019s performance. Instead the question is simple, and the answer is pure and true. Yes I would hire them again. Or no I would not. That is everything. A year is enough time to know. And if you don\u2019t know, the answer is almost certainly no. None of this is to say someone needs to be perfect. Few rarely are at one year, or ten! And perfection or perfect fit isn\u2019t what you\u2019re after anyway. It\u2019s someone\u2019s trajectory that\u2019s important. Great managers responsible for great teams know who\u2019d they hire again and who they wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s in that knowing where you\u2019ll find the serenity of decision. And the 12-month mark is the perfect moment to have that second chance to make that crucial call. It\u2019s through this direct method we\u2019ve hired, re-hired, and retained some of the best people in the business for years. We\u2019ve celebrated more 5, 10, and 15+ year anniversaries over our 24 years than I can remember. When the average tenure in our industry barely stretches 2 years, we\u2019re enormously proud of our record here. The results are real. And, BTW, if you\u2019re on the other side of the equation, ask yourself the same question in reverse. \u201cKnowing what I know now, would I take this job again?\u201d Because sticking around is doing exactly that \u2014 accepting the job again. I hope you find this method useful.

The first step is to understand what you\u2019re evaluating. If you just put the new design up against the old design, and compare the two, the old design will strongly influence your evaluation of the new design. This is OK if nothing\u2019s changed since the original design was launched. But it\u2019s likely a lot has changed since then \u2013 especially if many months or years have passed. Maybe there are new insights, maybe there\u2019s new data, maybe there\u2019s a new goal, maybe there\u2019s a new hunch, or maybe there\u2019s a whole new strategy at play.

So, when evaluating a redesign you have to know what you\u2019re looking for, not just what you\u2019re looking at.

There simply aren't that many big picture things or decisions to \"execute\" day in and day out \u2014 or even week in and week out \u2014 to make it a true full time job. A role yes, a hat to wear yes, a full-time job at a smallish company? No. It's part-time at best, quarter-time even better. Further, the fundamental responsibilities of Founders and CEOs are at odds. Having them mashed up in the same title is as ridiculous as having someone who's a \"CTO & Chief Luddite\". Why's that? Because a Founder's job is injecting risk into the business. It's flooding it with new ideas, stuff that seems hard to do, ideas that no one else would dare try, placing the kinds of bets that only someone who started the damn thing would be willing to wager. A Founders' job is basically to stay in business by almost always putting it out of business. A CEO's job? Just about the opposite. It's reducing risk, executing diligently to achieve obvious goals, staying in business at all costs. It's primarily about about being conservative, keeping the company's collective cool, and not letting things get out of hand. Just about everything that a Founder isn't doing.

I'm simply the part time one that fills the void when we need to bridge the gap, make a final big decision, and move on. As it should be. -Jason",

    "content": "Yesterday I was speaking to a university class and, as it usually does, a question about innovation came up. \"How do you stay innovative? How do you encourage innovative thinking at work?\" My answer: You don't stay innovative and you don't encourage innovative thinking at work. WHAT? Yes. Innovation should almost never happen. It's incredibly rare. It mostly happens by accident, not by intention. It's wonderful when it does, but you merely fluctuate in and out of it, it's not steady state. Work is mostly mundane. It's mostly maintenance. It's mostly local improvement and iteration. Work is mostly... Work. Any innovation is an outlier, nearly a rounding error. Even the most innovative projects or products are full of rote, prosaic stuff that still needs building. The poetic magic may be in the 5%, but the bulk of the work is in the other 95. So I told the students they'd better get used to that. Work is not often very exciting, but it can absolutely be fulfilling. And you can be excited about that. But if you're expecting breakthroughs all the time, riff sessions that constantly lead somewhere new, or brainstorms that shoot lightning, you're going to be disappointed. Yes innovation happens. Occasionally. Being happy at work is about finding challenge, reward, growth, and creative and intellectual stimulation in everything else. Now... back to this new product we're building. -Jason",

    "content": "A friend of mine called. He was overwhelmed by a home renovation project that ballooned in size. What started as a simple kitchen countertop replacement turned into more work in the kitchen, new lighting throughout the house, a master bathroom gut rehab, and new flooring in every room. It became too much. He felt like he was sinking and he couldn't find a grip to grab to prevent the downward spiral. This was his first time managing so many things at once, along with living with the mess that's inherent to demolition. Calm was hard to find, and clarity had left the building. With genuine concern distorting his voice, he said \"I'm in a bad spot. What do I do?\" So I asked him to give me a rundown on what was finished, and what was in progress. Essentially, step one is simply taking inventory. And that's where the problem became clear. What happened with his project is what happens with many projects, personal or work. Companies, in particular, are perpetually plagued by this problem: Too much unfinished business all at once. None of the projects in my friend's house were done. Everything was in progress. The kitchen countertops weren't done yet. The backsplash was halfway there. The lights were about 80% done. Some of the floors were ripped up, while more remained to demo. The master bath was half torn apart. And so on. Nothing done, everything started. Guys were jumping around between this and that, trying to make progress on the whole thing without finishing anything. Now, that might be OK if the initial crew was really large, and each project was being done by separate dedicated teams. But in this case, the contractor had a crew of three doing all the work, and a client piling on more projects as they went. So here are the clear instructions I gave: What started as a simple kitchen countertop replacement turned into more work in the kitchen, new lighting throughout the house, a master bathroom gut rehab, and new flooring in every room.

But in this case, the contractor had a crew of three doing all the work, and a client piling on more projects as they went. So here are the clear instructions I gave: \\- Stop everything. \\- Take status of everything. Where does each project broadly stand in terms of size, scope, completion, and unknowns. \\- Pick a smaller project that's almost done, and redirect all resources to finishing that one up before working on anything else. Get something finished. Establish \"completion discipline\". \\- Only move on to the next project once the current project is 100% done. \\- Do not add to the pile. No more new projects. There are subdivisions in the steps too. You can consider if what's open needs closing, what's doing needs to be done. But those are nuanced decisions that can easily trap you in indecision. The best process in this case is one that's easy to grasp and do: **Stop, status, selection, focus, finish, next.** This isn't about calling in reinforcements or adding more resources. This is about stopping, slowing down, eliminating the spread of attention, honing in, and driving to completion. Two days later, my friend calls me back. \"It's night night and day. The kitchen countertops are done, the backsplash in in progress and will be done end of day. Next we're moving to the master bathroom. It all feels under control again.\" The house is still a mess. That's the nature of construction. But at least his mind is clear, and the path ahead is obvious to everyone. Project management isn't just about guiding things down the perfect golden path. It can be about rescuing stuff that's gone off the rails. As much as we'd all like to avoid it, it does us no good to avoid admitting that it's often required. Rescue and repair is part of the natural cycle, and the better you get at it, the more progress you'll ultimately make. -Jason",

It became too time consuming, yet I still felt people deserved replies. So I started to feel a bit guilty. But I didn't start writing to feel guilty, so... What to do? What I wanted to do was send a single, kind reply to 24 people at once. But I didn't want to gather up their emails and do some strange BCC thing. That's also a hassle, and BCC's feel spammy. Now, I know I'm not the only one who runs into these sorts of situations. There are a number of scenarios where you may want to write the same thing to a collection of people in individual emails.

    "content": "Last week I was talking with another business owner from a different industry. He was frustrated with an employee who kept asking him what to do if x, y, or z happens. This was a long-time employee who'd been in these situations before, not someone new who was learning the ropes. With this particular employee, it's always the same set of questions no matter the situation. It could be a call with a client. If could be a meeting with another department. It could be a conversation with a vendor. What if they bring this up...? What if they bring that up...? What should I say if they say...? What about if they...? Essentially this employee wanted to be prepared for every contingency in a given situation. And they were great when everything went as anticipated. Being prepared sounds like a good idea, and you could understand why they might ask these questions. Considering the edge cases ahead of time is certainly useful. You might read the above and say 'Yeah, and? What's wrong with that?' There are many ways to prepare for any eventuality, and one of them is to literally prepare for all possible outcomes. But another one, and I'd say the more valuable \u2014 and useful \u2014 one is to become comfortable with the unknown. To develop on instinct around dealing with the situation whatever comes up. To know, not just to say. More jazz, less rock. More improv, less script. I'm not suggesting that someone who's I've found that those who develop a comfort with the unknown are the most delightful to work with. It's not that they know everything \u2014 they may know a lot less with someone who's studied every angle \u2014 but flexibility and independence is such a multiplier, that I'd take it any time over the alternative. The degrees of freedom you get with someone whose ability to work with 'let's see what they say' vs. 'what if they say?' are immeasurable. To be clear, there's nothing wrong with asking questions about things that could happen. Preparation is essential regardless. And if you can know every move ahead of time, knowing every counter move might be the way to go. But in the murky realm of people and motivations and strategy and incentives, trying to map it all out will lead to you more blindspots, not less. And then when things go off the golden path, you're stuck needing directions with no one to ask. At least that's how I see it.

    "title": "Delegating Projects vs Tasks: Transitioning to Ownership",
    "content": "We recently received this email from a [REWORK Podcast](https://37signals.com/podcast/) listener who had a question......I think it was in[Shape Up] that the idea of delegating projects rather than tasks came up. And I'm trying to move this way, of working with my own team. I just wonder if you guys have any tips or help for making that transition, helping team members take ownership for their areas of work, maybe obstacles I can watch out for leading my team in this way as we move in this direction. We have a small team, just a handful of people. But I would love to move in this direction where they're taking more ownership and I can delegate whole projects rather than, um, me kind of owning the project and then delegating tasks... We're likely going to address this question out loud on an upcoming podcast AMA, but I wanted to write up a response as well. So here goes. When we ultimately decide what to work on over the next [6-week cycle](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01#six-week-cycles), we assign specific projects to specific [teams of two](https://world.hey.com/jason/just- the-two-of-us-afb2f54e). And that's the last assigning, or delegating, we do on that project. Once a team of two (one programmer and one designer) is assigned to a project, *they* determine how to approach it, *they* determine the steps they're going to take, *they* determine the tasks they need to complete to get it done. *They* fill up the Card Table or To-Do Lists in their respective Basecamp project. They, they, they. Projects start with a name, the people involved, and, typically, a kickoff message describing the project in a few hundred words. But that's it. The rest starts blank and its on them to fill it in as they go. That's the other thing \u2014 a project may start with a small handful of tasks on day one, two, or three. Work is added as the project progresses, as more discoveries about the work are made. Things make the list as they need to, not in anticipation of being needed. No one defines all the work up front. That's a fools errand. Assuming you know too much up front is the best way to find out you're wrong in the end. Instead we define the direction, the purpose, the reason, and a few specific \"must haves\" up front. The rest \u2014 all the rest, which is mostly everything \u2014 is determined during the project, by the people on the project. Day three may have 12 open to-dos. But by day 14, there might be 20. And by day 15, there may be 30. Eventually that number begins to dwindle as scopes are completed, and work wraps up. As that team thinks things through, sometimes they'll make to-dos for each other since they know who will be responsible for which parts of the project. They're on the ground, they know best. But there's no one outside the project making to- dos for them, assigning them work, or otherwise telling them what to do. In other words, you don't show up waiting to be told what to do, you do what you determine needs to be done. That's how they own the outcome. They aren't responsible for determining if the feature was a good idea to build in the first place, but they do own if it works as-built. This can come to a shock to some people \u2014 especially new employees that come from more traditional organizations where their manager effectively gives them a list of tasks or goals or whatever every day. \"Here's your 12 things to get done today.\" That's not how we work. Here it's \"Here's the stuff I've decided to work on today to make progress on the project we're working on together.\" Along the way other people can check in, or be pulled in for advice, review, a second opinion, etc. But that demand is primarily driven by the teams themselves. Sometimes if we haven't noticed enough progress, or sensed something's stuck in the mud, we'll jump in, poke around, and see if we can help, but most of the time, outside assistance is purely demand driven from the inside, not the outside. QA is one minor exception. As a project moves on, QA floats in. And when they spot issues, they may assign those issues directly to either the designer or the programmer, depending on their determination of responsibility. Other times they just add them to the triage section of the [Card Table](https://basecamp.com/features/card-table) and the team divvies them up depending on how they see the responsibility. As for tips, I don't have many other than try this on something small and relatively inconsequential to start. But real. Don't practice real work on fake projects. Chunk off something, put a couple of people on it, define the concept you're after, and let them loose on it. You may need to try this a few times to get the hang of it. Your job, as the manager or team lead, is to let go. Resist the urge to define, the urge to lay out the path ahead of them. That's their job, and they'll only get better at it if you let them do it. You can do this. -Jason",

Even Zuck, master of a megacorp, is noticing it: Even Zuck, master of a megacorp, is noticing it: \"Since we reduced our workforce last year, one surprising result is that many things have gone faster... Indirect costs compound and it\u2019s easy to underestimate them... A leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster\" A number of years ago I wrote a piece lauding the number three. I meant every word. Three person teams are incredibly efficient. But what's better than three? Two. Over the past few years, the number of people who work here has continued to grow, but we've downsized our product teams from three to two. At 37signals, both Basecamp and HEY are built by multiple teams of two using our Shape Up process. No feature takes more than 6 weeks to build, and each feature is assigned a maximum of two people: one designer and one programmer. And in more than a few cases, it may just be one person. How can we build so much software in such a short amount of time with tiny teams of two? That's how. If it takes more than two people, it can't. We won't let it. We'll clear it up, simplify it down, make more tradeoffs, find more elegance. If it can't fit into two, it's not ready to do. That's the discipline, and it all has to start there. Two people. This starts at hiring, of course, but it goes back further. It starts with desire: The desire to move real quality very quickly out the door to customers. And not to get caught in the corporate quicksand that swallows so many organizations whole. Big teams not only slow shit down, they expand the surface area of discontent. Talk to any large team, and you can feel the heat of frustration radiating outward. A similar heat radiates down from management \u2014 frustrated by the lack of progress. Just like work expands to fill the time available, work expands to fill the team available. Small, short projects become bigger, longer projects simply because all those people need something to do. Small is not less than. It\u2019s greater than. It\u2019s faster than. It\u2019s better than. We're often changing how we work at 37signals, but I feel like this one's settled on the product side. Two person teams simply can't be beat. Want to do more than two people can do? Add another two person team to to the mix on something else. That's what you do. Don't add them to what you're doing, add them to something you aren't. Four people making progress on two different features at the same time, rather than four people struggling to deliver one thing on time. I know companies will continue to miss the point here. Yes, they'll get smaller... Maybe go from 12 to 10 on a team. Or even cut a team in half to 6. But it's still way too much. Jump ahead, break your teams into teams of two. Adopt Shape Up, scope and shape your work accordingly. Work the tradeoffs, get good at spotting the essentials. Get tight. Then you'll see what you can really do. Get two it.",

And not just do, but do just as well \u2014 or better. Every company has different priorities of course, but let's examine a few things. With the information I was able to find online... Monday has about 1500 employees. Asana has about 1600 employees. Clickup has about 1000 employees. Slack has about 2500 employees. Smartsheet has about 3000 employees. These companies compete directly with my company, 37signals. Each of these companies has somewhere between 100-150k paying customers. Give or take a few ten thousand. And thousands more free users too. Guess what? We do too. We're right in that ballpark as well. None of these companies, us included, have an order of magnitude more customers than the other. Of course none of this is apples-to-apples, as every company is different, but we're still talking fruit. This isn't apples-to-chickens. We all offer similar kinds of products that do similar-enough things for purpose of comparison. Revenues and profits may be different, but that's a matter of business model, not the number of people served, or the quality of service. And how many employees do we have at 37signals? Around 80 (which is the most we've ever had). And are they working ridiculous all-nighters or weekends to make up for the significantly smaller team? No \u2014 we all work about 40 hours a week. What's our uptime? Exceptional. How's our customer service? Friendly, quick, and thorough. How do our customers feel about our products? Here's what 1000 have to say about Basecamp, for example. Similar story for HEY. On top of that, we also maintain two previous versions of Basecamp, Highrise, Campfire, and Backpack for thousands of customers who remain on earlier versions or older products. Building complex, large organizations is a choice, not a requirement. We chose differently. Other companies might as well. So it's absolutely possible to run a tight ship, deliver outstanding products, offer the highest level of customer service, and have exceptional uptime with a small, focused, high-quality crew working reasonable hours while living in a dozen different cities around the world. As for Twitter, I don't know what the right number is \u2014 and it's really not a number, it's about distribution and concentration. If you had 8000 people at Twitter, and they were all in sales, Twitter would be in trouble. So you obviously have to have the right people in the right places doing the right jobs, but thousands upon thousands is not a requirement simply because there were thousands upon thousands before. And I'm obviously not comparing the complexity of running a service like Twitter with Basecamp or HEY, but I do think it's very fair to compare Monday and Asana and Clickup and Slack, among others, to Basecamp and HEY. And we're able to service around the same number of customers, and actually generate more profit than all of them combined (since they're losing hundreds of millions annually, between them). Small is not less than. It's an advantage. -Jason",

But ideas don't give a shit about any of those things. Ideas like the shower. Ideas like our pillows. Ideas like commutes. Ideas like walks. Ideas like the morning, or late nights. Ideas like daydreams. Ideas like you doing something else so they can surprise you. Ideas aren't contained. They aren't located. They don't reside. They're nomadic. They aren't something you control \u2014 they bubble up, they arise. You don't get to have them when you want. They come to you. Certain settings or conditions may spark a thought, but you don't need to be in a room with other people for great ones to emerge. And you absolutely don't need to be huddled up breathing the same air to work on an idea. To play with an idea. To toss one back and forth with a partner, or two, or five. You just need the right minds, wherever they are, feeding on insights, wrapped around the same concepts. It's a fluid process, not a fixed one. You need communication, not presence. There may be times when being physically together helps something materialize. This can be especially true when you're making something physical (like a clay model) rather than virtual (like software).

    "content": "Attend enough business conferences, read loads of LinkedIn posts, or listen to enough motivational speakers and you\u2019ll hear one piece of advice repeated over and over again: You\u2019ve got to love what you do! If you don\u2019t love what you do, you might as well stay home. No less a giant than Steve Jobs famously told Stanford\u2019s 2005 graduating class, \u201cThe only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\u2019t found it yet, keep looking. Don\u2019t settle.\u201dI don\u2019t buy it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with loving what you do, of course \u2013 I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a prerequisite for starting a business or building a fulfilling career, let alone doing great work. In fact, I think it\u2019s disingenuous for really successful people to put so much of the focus on love, just as it\u2019s disingenuous for really rich people to say money doesn\u2019t matter. People tend to romanticize their own motivations and histories. They value what matters to them now, and forget what really mattered to them when they started. It\u2019s human nature, so it\u2019s an easy thing to do. Many great businesses and important innovations are actually born out of frustration or even hate rather than love. I talk to entrepreneurs all the time, and many of their companies sprang into existence for similar reasons\u2014because the founder wanted something that didn\u2019t exist or scoped out an opportunity to do something better than it had been done before. Love for their subject matter may or may not play a role in their stories, but hate for the existing options, along with strong opinions about how things could work, does and is a much better predictor of success. My own career is no exception. Back in the mid-\u201990s, I was looking for a simple tool to keep track of my music collection, and all of the available programs seemed bloated and unnecessarily complex. Those are two things I despise, so I set out to make my own tool and eventually released it under the name Audiofile. I didn\u2019t love music collecting. I didn\u2019t even love software development. (I was just learning it at the time.) And I didn\u2019t have any aspirations to run a software business \u2013 I just saw a need, couldn't find anything I thought was great, and I built something better. Nothing wrong with that. A similar situation led me to start and build 37signals and Basecamp. HEYEven today I don\u2019t always love what I do. The paperwork, the reporting, the day-to-day minutiae that come along with responsibility for growing company that's bigger than it's ever been \u2013 none of those things make me swoon. Yet I\u2019d still rather be running 37signals than doing anything else. I think I\u2019m fairly good at it, every day I get to do challenging, creative work, and I continue to find making better software a worthy and rewarding cause. It\u2019s also a real pleasure to work with such amazing people as I do every day of the week. Isn't that plenty? If I were giving a motivational speech, I\u2019d say that, if you want to be successful and make a real contribution to the world, you have to be intrinsically motivated by the work you do, and you have to feel good about spending your days on it. Love might grow \u2013 and it\u2019s a wonderful thing if it does\u2014but you don\u2019t need it up front. You can succeed just by wanting something to exist that doesn\u2019t already. -Jason",

They're trying to track everything, and asking people to attribute \"experience\" to things that are mere, routine happenings. Most things just don't need to be rated. For example, after a recent delivery, I got this text message: They ask me to rate my \"experience\". Thing is, I didn't have an *experience*. The delivery person just left the package by the mailbox and I grabbed it when I got home. And what does it mean to even rate a delivery like this? It showed up, it was correct... Is that a 5-star *experience*? Would it only be worth 3 stars if the package was lying on the ground instead of propped up against the wall? There isn't enough *there*there to even establish a value. If you're going to ask anything, a more apt question might be \"Did the correct prescription show up on time?\" Then I can answer yes or no. But *rate the experience*? And every time I get a prescription, it's the same question about the *experience*. I know what they're getting at, and I'm probably belaboring the point, but I'm seeing this everywhere and I can't help but think it's generating data that's incompatible with the actual situation. Being asked to rate minutia with a 10-point scale, and ascribe depth of an experience to something that's effectively flat and one dimensional, is overshooting the goal. -Jason",

What keeps me motivated is the *doing*itself.I keep doing something because I like doing something. I keep building and improving our products because I like improving our products. I keep writing because I enjoy writing. I keep pursuing an interest because the interest interests me. I keep... because I like... I can be that simple, and I'd argue it's best when it's just that. -Jason",

But since I was on a bike, there's really no where for it to go other than So I tossed it on the ground, broadly aiming \u2014 without accuracy or expectations of precision \u2014 towards a small pile of personal affects on the ground a few feet from the bike. It bounced once, and miraculously stuck the landing on top of my Airpods case. A perfect 10. For a second there I was proud of myself. Look what I did! But a moment later, that glow flickered out and reality set in \u2014 it was just luck, pure chance. And there's no fucking way I could do that again. And, further, even contemplating that I could do it again would be delusional. In fact, had I tried again, I'd try too hard. Any trying would be too hard. You've probably had a similar experience with something else. You don't even think about it and it works out. You try, it doesn't. You try harder, it really doesn't. I had no expectations of that key landing comfortably on that Airpod case. And it's because I had no expectations that it was possible. Then I jump cut to another thought... This is just like business. We land where we land. Trying too hard narrows the desirable outcomes. Expectations are the enemy here \u2014 they limit the number of great landing spots, and make the idealized one impossibly hard. Relax your expectations, and hundreds of positive possibilities open up. When you don't go in with expectations, you almost always come out ahead. It's better to have a wide gaze, point in a general direction, do your best, and just see what happens. The distinction is subtle, but it's there nonetheless.

You can always flip the bit between yes or no, or now or not now, but there's no middle ground. You're always free to reconsider what to do next once the yes/now plate is cleared. Or if you move something out of now, into not now, and free up a spot for something else. Be definitive, know what you're getting yourself into, control scope by deciding yes or no.

We found ourselves in the same city, so it felt like it was time to shake hands and catch up IRL. He runs a company that's an order or magnitude larger than 37signals, so his experiences, responsibilities, and perspectives are quite a bit different from mine. But as we've careened towards our own renewed growth phase \u2014 we're currently larger than we've ever been, and still hiring \u2014 a few of his insights really resonated. And one really stuck. When he said it, I had to repeat it to make sure I heard it right. I wanted to sear the words in my brain so I both fully understood and wouldn't forget. He said \"Risk tolerance is the scarcest resource in most companies.\" I just love how that's framed. He then went on to say, and this one I'm paraphrasing a bit, that it's the one of the things that sets founder-led companies apart from founder-less companies. Founder-led companies tend to take more risks. They're more risk tolerant, less risk averse. He also related this to company size. This one's a bit more obvious \u2014 the larger the company, the more risk averse they are, even if they're still founder-led. But it's not just a pure function of size, which is the typical conclusion. No, it's about *distance*. The further away a founder is from would-be risky decisions, the more likely those decisions will be *safe*decisions. It's only natural. It made me realize something I may have inherently understood, but hadn't really realized was a unique responsibility of a founder who's still running the show: It's my job \u2014 my obligation, really \u2014 to fill the coffers with risk. It's my role to make sure there's an ample supply. No one else will produce it, and few will introduce it. The more it's drained, the more it needs to rain. While the company at large is focused on results, founders should be focused on taking chances. There are certain risks founders need to take that others will not. Step function changes, for example. Things that can't be explained by past results and experiments, but a hunch that the equation has changed. All the while keeping in mind that there's a notable difference between taking a risk and putting yourself at risk. So, if you've decided you want to take a risk, then take it. If you don't, then keep talking about it \u2014 it'll almost certainly talk you out of it. The safer option is the most abrasive \u2014 it'll wear down the risk, polish the edges, and make the object of beautiful and smooth. But risk needs to snag, or it isn't much of a risk at all. -Jason",

If you're putting something off until the last minute, it's assumed it's because you don't want to do it, or it's too hard, or you've been avoiding it for some other reason. Maybe I'm making excuses, but lately I've found procrastination can be aimed to your advantage. Not always, but more than I imagined. Procrastination has a way of concentrating attention. When it has to be done, and the clock is ticking, it blocks your attention from wandering to other things. There's simply no time, and the penalty for further delay is high. Concentrated attention, at least for me, helps me do my best work. It's as if attention is a reduced sauce, thickened and viscous, sticking to what I'm working on. Undivided, undiluted, unbroken. Procrastination helps wedge me into a sustained flow state. \"I have to get it done this afternoon\" turns into 3 or 4 hours of continuous, focused work. When the deadline is over the horizon, it's too easy to shatter those hours into ineffective slices of attention doled out over days or weeks. But when it's right in front of you, you tuck in, get real, and get it done. There are obviously occasions where you wish you had more time, or a second take, or another edit, but, more often than not, I find more time talks you out of your best ideas, and slips in too many second guesses. I think I'd rather take something slightly undercooked than overcooked. One downside of waiting is if others are waiting on you. Procrastination is disrespect if others need what you're making in order to move forward on what they need to make. So be sure to take that all into consideration too. You can't wait until the 11th hour, if it forces everyone else into the 12th.",

Hello again. -Jason Then about 8 years ago in 2014 we decided to go all-in and focus on just one product moving forward. That product was Basecamp, our biggest hit. To eliminate any doubt about our newfound focus, we renamed the entire company from 37signals to Basecamp. We were now Basecamp, the makers of Basecamp.But then in 2018 we had an itch we couldn't ignore. We had some new ideas for email \u2014 a long neglected, but wonderful and essential part of the internet. The last time email had been interesting was back in 2004, when Gmail came out. It was long past time to bring email into the future. With that, we spent a couple years building HEY. We launched it in early 2020 to massive commercial and critical acclaim. We signed up tens of thousands of paying customers in just a few months, and we had a bonafide hit on our hands. That hit continues.So now that brings us to today. We aren't a one product company anymore. We're two. Basecamp and HEY. And that itch that HEY scratched is back again. We have more ideas we want to bring to life. Calling our company Basecamp just doesn't make a lot of sense when we make more than just Basecamp.

We've always tried to lead with ideas, take principled stands, and remain allergic to conformity and corporate sterility.

    "title": "Renewing the Tradition: Basecamp's Miami Meetup",
    "content": "We've worked remotely for nearly 20 years, but we've sustained the distance by lining up intense, one-week-together-in-person bursts twice a year. Over the last 10 years, we've mainly held these bi-annual all-company meetups at our Chicago office. But the combination of the pandemic, and an expiring office lease in July of 2020, conspired to keep us apart for nearly 2.5 years. With the pandemic fading, mask mandates sunsetting, and travel opening back up, it was time to renew the tradition. So this last week, nearly our whole company got together in Miami for our first meetup in what felt like forever. With 65 people from 16 countries, Basecamp is now the biggest and broadest we\u2019ve ever been. Understandably not everyone could make it to the meetup for a number of reasons, but nearly 50 did, with the furthest-away flying in from Nairobi. I'm an introvert and homebody that's hardly comfortable always-on socializing with such a large group for days on end, but I have to tell you, I just loved it. Remote work remains our preferred method \u2014 and we'll continue building our global group remotely \u2014 but getting together like this brings crystal to clear: Nothing beats a meal, a smile, a handshake, and a hug in person. When a shared experience is the reason, humans connect better in person than they do over the internet. And, as it turns out, meeting infrequently makes those actual encounters far more meaningful. We didn't Miami was sunny, yes, but the camaraderie and fellowship was even sunnier. There was clearly a warm glow we'd all been missing. And with only one employee local to Miami, everyone else was in from out of town. It cemented the idea of being away, together, which amplified the shared experience. So, what did we do? We spent the first half of the first day introducing the more than 30 new people we've hired over the last eight months or so. Then Elaine (COO) took the stage and shared an update on the company itself. How we're growing, where we're going, and what we're focused on organizationally to put all this change to good use. After that, David and I took the stage to talk product and vision. We shared updates on Basecamp and HEY, discussed launch plans for Basecamp 4 this year, talked about some other news we'll be sharing publicly soon, and riffed on a few more product ideas that we're tossing around in our heads. Then it was lunch, some personal talks people signed up to give in the afternoon, and then off to the first all-company dinner. The following days after that were full of planned day trips and activities in and outside of Miami, an in-depth all-company training session that helped us to get to know one another in a novel new way, management and leadership training, small team meals, a heartfelt peer appreciation and recognition session, celebrating work anniversaries for those at 5-year increments (including one at 15 years), and a festive closing dinner with everyone on the last night. What a week. It's unusual to be both completely exhausted, but equally energized. But that's how I feel, and I'm hearing it from others too. This was a major reset, a chance to reinforce old relationships, form new connective tissue, and take a healthy hit from the optimism pipe. There were moments of reflection and appreciation, and a celebration of the culmination of new efforts we've been making, together, over the past year. We were just people from all over, loosely tied through shared work, simply having a great time. But there was something more. Even people who've worked together for 10 years felt like new friends. And those who were brand new fit right in. It was our company, it was our time, and it was just wonderful. If you've been remote for a while, now's the time \u2014 get together again. I really encourage you to draw the line, leap over it, and move on. It'll be the fresh start that everyone's been craving.",

    "content": "A friend of mine is pissed off. He hired someone to replace a bunch of windows at his house. The guy did the work. Poorly. And now it turns out he needs to have everything redone. Given how badly the job went, he's going to work with someone else to get it done right the second time. What's there isn't really salvageable. Even the windows themselves need to be reordered. It's a big number, it's real money. He's going to try to get some money back from the original guy who messed up the job, but it's a long road. Outcomes unknown. So he's staring at a big loss. He called me to talk about it. He asked me if I've ever experienced something like this, and how I coped with it. I absolutely have, and I've always found that how you frame it has a huge impact on how you feel about it. It allows you to move on. I told him the way I've approached this sort of thing in the past is to frame it as 'overall, this job cost more than I expected', rather than 'This guy fucked me, I'm out $X, and now I have to pay someone else $Y more to redo it'. Yes, the total is the same, but one involves loss while the other involves missed expectations. I find it a lot easier to deal with underestimating total cost than feeling like I got screwed. Construction projects frequently go over budget. People deal with this all the time. The community is large! You're a member now. Loss aversion is of course how it's described, but applying technical definitions doesn't often change how you feel. Being able to reframe it does.",

    "content": "Way back when, we used to release new software on Fridays all the time. That often meant working Saturdays and Sundays to fix an urgent problem with the new stuff, wrecking the weekend for whoever did the release. It was stupid yet predictable, because we kept setting deadlines at the end of the week, as most naturally do. But Friday is the worse day to release anything. First off, you probably rushed to finish before the weekend. So work done on Fridays tends to be a bit sloppy. Second, Mondays don't come after Fridays. Saturdays and Sundays do. So if something goes wrong, someone's working the weekend. Third, if you work the weekends, you don't get a chance to recharge. Basically, when you've worked all week, and you're forced to work the weekend, the following Monday is the eighth day of last week, not the first day of next week. This means that if you keep working through the following week, you're working 12-day weeks. That's no good. So here we were, creating unnecessary stress for ourselves.

I used to play years ago, but probably only retained 10% of what I knew, so I was as close to starting from scratch as any barely-experienced player could be. Basically, I could dabble and play some chords, but my skills plateaued quickly after that. And it's a lonely, desolate, tumbleweedy-flat plateau. You don't get better hanging out there. So that's why I'm back to in-person lessons. I tried YouTube, I tried some books, I tried an app or two, I tried a bunch of stuff, but I've discovered I simply learn guitar best with one-on-one in-person instruction. And I've gotten better. But I've also discovered there's another dimension that unlocks with practice: It would be easy to dismiss feeling better as the identical twin of getting better. But I've found there's a difference. Getting better is about improving specifically, feeling better is about confidence and comfort. It's a certain ease that develops alongside getting better. I feel better about the guitar itself \u2014 it's no longer this intimidating object. Granted, I've got 1000 miles to go before I get where I want to be with it, but I've passed the first waypoint: It just I find myself picking up the guitar more frequently. Not to literally practice, but to literally fuck around. Now that I feel better about it, I've given myself more latitude to have some fun with it.

And I didn't like it because I wasn't any good at it. I was learning, I could make stuff, but I didn't feel comfortable yet. I hadn't pocketed enough skills to feel at ease.

You call the front desk to mention it, and they say, oh yeah, they know about that, and someone is going to come fix that next week (after you\u2019ve left).

Yeah, sure, some water and ice cream would be great! Everyone wants to be heard and respected. It usually doesn\u2019t cost much to do either. And it doesn\u2019t really matter all that much whether you ultimately think you\u2019re right and they\u2019re wrong. Arguing with heated feelings will just increase the burn. Keep that in mind the next time you take a token. Which one are you leaving for the customer? \u2014 *This essay was republished from our book \"It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work\".",

    "title": "The Calm Company: Basecamp's Approach to Remote Work and Productivity",
    "content": "As a general rule, nobody at Basecamp really knows where anyone else is at any given moment. Are they working? Dunno. Are they taking a break? Dunno. Are they at lunch? Dunno. Are they picking up their kid from school? Dunno. Don\u2019t care. The vast majority of the time, it just doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is letting people design their own schedule around when they can do their best work. This is not nearly as hard as it sounds. But it does require a shift in mindset. Away from \u201cI have to call Jeff into a meeting now to get his take on this new feature idea\u201d to \u201cI\u2019ll write up my feature idea for Jeff to check-out whenever he has some free time, and then, maybe, we can have a chat about it live later, if needed\u201d. If you\u2019re constantly pulling people into things, then yeah, where they are right now matters. But if you prefer to let people consider something fully, and get back to you when they\u2019re ready, then it doesn\u2019t matter where they are right now. We choose the latter. We\u2019ve always worked like this at Basecamp. Since we\u2019ve always been a remote company with people spread out all over the world, we\u2019ve been forced to work this way. We learned to appreciate the benefits of working asynchronously quickly as we collaborated over seven time zones right from the start. But it wasn\u2019t until we gave up on Presence that we really got to embrace the sense of calm that comes from not caring about when someone is working (or not) or where someone is (or isn\u2019t) at this very moment. Presence is a feature of many modern communication work tools. It\u2019s generally represented by a green, red, or yellow dot. If there\u2019s a green dot next to someone\u2019s name it means they\u2019re available. Yellow or red means they\u2019re away. This is how many companies get a read on who\u2019s working when. For years we used an internal instant messaging system that broadcasted everyone\u2019s real-time status. It seemed cool, it seemed useful. It seemed like something that would be good to know. But it turned out to be TMI: Too Much Information. Because, really, what does \u201cavailable\u201d and \u201caway\u201d really mean? Official definitions don\u2019t matter, because here\u2019s what they actually mean: \u201cAvailable to be bothered\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m running away and hiding because I can\u2019t get any fucking work done around here.\u201d Away, in particular, can be seen as bad form. Stay \u201caway\u201d (which most often actually means you\u2019re working, but don\u2019t want to be bothered) and people begin to question if you\u2019re at work at all. Leave \u201caway\u201d on too long and you\u2019re seen as unreliable. If you\u2019ve got presence on your work tools, you\u2019ve probably lived this very thing. What a joke, right? And \u201cavailable\u201d is usually just an invitation to be interrupted. Try being available for 3 hours, and then try being away for 3 hours. Bet you get more work done when you\u2019re marked away. Truth is, there are hardly any good reasons to know if someone\u2019s available or away at any given moment. If you truly need something from someone, ask them. If they respond, then you have what you needed. If they don\u2019t, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re ignoring you \u2014 it\u2019s because they\u2019re busy. Respect that! Assume people are focused on their own work. Are there exceptions? Of course. It might be good to know who\u2019s around in a true emergency, but 1% occasions like that shouldn\u2019t drive policy 99% of the time. And there are times where certain teams need to make sure someone\u2019s around so there are no gaps in customer service coverage, but those are specialized cases best handled by communication, not an ambiguous colored dot next to someone\u2019s name. These days at Basecamp we eschew status, we reject presence, we avoid abstraction. In fact, when designing the latest version of Basecamp, we deliberately decided to keep status and presence out of the product. We had it early on during the design process, but then we turned it off and we never missed it. The moment it was gone, a burden was lifted and things calmed down around here. So take a step towards calm, and relieve people from needing to broadcast their status. They\u2019ve got enough work to do \u2014 managing how they\u2019re presenting their availability to the company at large is an unnecessary burden. Everyone\u2019s status should be implicit: I\u2019m trying to do my job, please respect my time and attention.",

    "title": "Deployments: How we announce new features and updates internally at Basecamp",
    "content": "A few weeks ago I shared how we write Heartbeats at Basecamp. Heartbeats are written by team leads that summarize their team's work over the past 6-week cycle. They are published to Basecamp, and shared with everyone at Basecamp, so everyone knows what's happening across the company. The post was really well received, and people have been clamoring for me to share more of our internal processes and posts. Our book Shape Up covers a lot of this in principle, but, since it's a book, it's obviously not going to have current, ongoing real-world examples. And who doesn't like to see the real stuff? I sure do! So here, let's look at something that was posted internally, today. Deployments In our own Basecamp account, we have a project called Deployments. Everyone in the company has access to the Deployment project. Whenever we ship a new feature or update to any one of our products, one of the people who did the work also writes up a message in the Deployment project that explains what's new, points out what could be an issue, and, in some cases, provides a link to the repo on Github. Here's a snapshot of the Message Board inside the Deployment project. Just this morning we shipped a brand new feature in Basecamp called The Lineup. Dorin was the lead designer on the project and wrote up the internal Deployment notice. Here it is: Now that's only the the top. Here's a link to read the entire Deployment notice, exactly as it was published internally. You'll see it contains screenshots, explanations of how things work, animations showing specific interactions, the why's behind the how's, decisions that were made, and a variety of details that demonstrate the work that went into the feature, etc. Often time these Deployment write-ups are posted a bit ahead of actually shipping the project. They're sort of a heads up \u2014 something new is coming and going out to customers shortly. And then, once it ships, someone follows up with a comment like this: In the example above, Dorin (the designer on the project) posted the big announcement at 10:34am, and Pratik (the programmer on the project, and the one who deployed the update), posted his 'This is now live!' comment at 10:49am, about 15 minutes later. Aside from these Deployment notices keeping everyone informed of what's new at a high level, they're wonderful for those on the front lines too. People answering questions from customers, anyone interacting with customers on Twitter or LinkedIn, etc. Everyone internally knows, and everyone internally can speak with confidence on how things work, why things work the way they work, etc. And of course, since everything in Basecamp has a comments thread attached, any follow-up questions or updates on the release can be posted right on this page as well. No spreading stuff all over the place in different chat transcripts \u2014 in Basecamp, everything is contextual, in the right place, attached, and easy to find and reference later. And what's especially useful about the Deployments project, and the Message Board in particular, is that over time we're automatically building an institutional library of progress. Here's what we've done, here's how we've done it, and here's how it works. It's such a great place for new employees to get up to speed on the kind of work we do, and it's full of examples of how we communicate internally and externally about the work we ship. Whenever I see a notification in my Basecamp Hey menu from the Deployments project, it puts a special smile on my face. It's a celebration of progress, of teamwork, of our products getting better, or our customers getting something new, and of good writing making its way across the company. -Jason About Jason Fried Hey!

During the development of most any product, there are always times when things aren\u2019t quite right. Times when you feel like you may be going backwards a bit. Times where it\u2019s almost there, but you can\u2019t yet figure out why it isn\u2019t. Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019re seeing in front of you. Yet. That\u2019s when you need to have faith. There are designs that are close, but not there yet. There are obvious conflicts that will need to be resolved. There are lingering things that confound you, confuse you, or upset you, but you know that eventually they\u2019ll work themselves out. Eventually you\u2019ll find the right way to do something you\u2019ve been struggling with. It\u2019s hard to live with something that isn\u2019t quite right yet \u2013 especially when it\u2019s your job to get it right.

And, eventually, you\u2019ll figure it all out. It\u2019ll all work out in the end. This is what I\u2019ve always believed, and have always tried to practice. A dedicated faith in the eventual resolution of a problem, the eventual execution of a concept, and the eventual realization of the right design. Even when something\u2019s poking out you don\u2019t like, or something isn\u2019t aligning quite right, or the words aren\u2019t as elegant as you\u2019d hoped, or something just isn\u2019t easy enough yet, you need to have confidence it\u2019ll all come together *eventually*.Remember that what you\u2019re making is in a perpetual state of almost right up until the end. And it's never right even after. In the meantime, you just press on and keep making things, trying things, and getting closer and closer to the time when you can tie the loose ends into a perfect bow and present it to the world.

    "title": "Why the Hell Not Moments",
    "content": "Whenever I dive into something new, I try to find at least one \u201cwhy the hell not?\u201d moment. And when I can, I try to leave evidence of that moment in whatever it is that I\u2019m building. When we launched our company (37signals) back in 1999, we launched a black and white, text-only site without a single piece of portfolio work to be found. All the other agencies we were competing with had very flashy pages, loaded with pictures of their work. So why black and white and text only? Because why the hell not lead with ideas rather than compete on pictures? We thought it could be better that way. It worked out well for us. One of my favorite why the hell not moments was when we were writing REWORK. One of the things that always bugs me about paper books is that you have to leaf through a dozen or so pages before you arrived at page one of the actual text. You\u2019ve got the testimonials, the table of contents, the dedication/acknowledgement page, the copyright page, usually a blank page, a title page, etc\u2026 THEN you get to the book. This is also one of the reasons I really like cracking into a new book on the Kindle \u2014 you start right at the text. So when we were talking to our publisher about how we wanted REWORK to be organized and designed, I asked them if we could put the copyright page at the end, rather than the beginning. It would be one fewer page to leaf through up front, and if any page was ignored more than the others, it had to be the copyright page. So why the hell not just put it at the back? Initially our publisher didn\u2019t know how to respond. No one had ever asked that before and they\u2019d never seen an example of a copyright page in the back. But ultimately they said yes, so today if you pick up a copy of REWORK, and go to the last page, you\u2019ll find the copyright page right there in the back of the book on page 280: You\u2019ll also find the acknowledgement page on page 279, rather than right up front: Whenever I\u2019m struggling with a decision that seems \u201cunusual\u201d, I\u2019ll look back at these two pages in REWORK and remind myself that just because everyone else does something one way doesn\u2019t mean you have to do it that way. Sometimes it\u2019s just worth saying why the hell not and going for it. Hey! I'm Jason, the Co-Founder and CEO at 37signals, makers of Basecamp and HEY.

    "title": "Long-Form Writing at Basecamp: Heartbeats and More",
    "content": "We're famous for having very few meetings at Basecamp. We generally think meetings are toxic. Yet, meetings do convey information, and we need to convey information, so what's our replacement? Writing. Long-form, complete-thought, considered writing. We write a lot at Basecamp. Since long-form writing is an asynchronous form of communication, people can publish thoughts when they're ready, and others can read them, consider them, and respond to them when they have time. No synchronization of schedules required, no pulling people off their work to sit around a table (or show their face in a box on the screen), and none of the FOMO or stress that's tied to real-time communication like group chat. Long-form writing takes many forms at Basecamp, but \"Heartbeats\" are a prime example. Heartbeats \u2014 written by team leads roughly every 6 weeks \u2014 are published to a message board in a Basecamp project called \"What Works\". Everyone in the company can see this project, and can read every Heartbeat. A Heartbeat summarizes all the work the team did over the last 6-week cycle. It's a way to celebrate progress, recognize contributions, and detail the sheer quantity of work a team gets done in a relatively short period of time (via standard ~40-hour weeks). It's a perfect way for everyone to get to know what's happening across every team in the company \u2014 all without having to schedule a thing. Let's take a look at an example of an actual Heartbeat. We've opened it up via a public Basecamp link so everyone can see it. This one was written by Jeff, who leads up the Product Programming team here at Basecamp. This Heartbeat is about 95% the same as the one we published internally \u2014 a few things have been struck, changed, or modified since they weren't originally written for public consumption. Jeff has granted me permission to share this publicly. Note the links in the Heartbeat won't work b/c they are links to our internal Basecamp account. Now multiply that Heartbeat by many teams \u2014 programmers, designers, security, customer service, operations, admin, etc \u2014 and you can see how these Heartbeats become a wonderful record of everything that's happening across the whole company on a regular basis. A library of accomplishments (and, sometimes, setbacks) for everyone's benefit \u2014 including future employees who don't work here yet. Reading back through Heartbeats are a great way to get a sense of the things we do around here, how we work, who's doing what, and how we recognize each other's efforts. Make sense? Heartbearts are just one example of the kind of long-form writing we do here. In a future post, I'll talk about Kickoffs \u2014 predictions for what we want to get done in the next 6 weeks. Both Heartbeats and Kickoffs are fundamental parts of our Shape Up process. Hope this was helpful. If you have any questions, lemme know. -Jason About Jason Fried Hey!

    "title": "Understanding Distracting Elements in Design",
    "content": "In the course of designing user interfaces, and processing feedback about designs, one sometimes runs into a 'That's distracting' comment about something specific in the design. You may even say it \u2014 or feel it \u2014 about something you're designing. What's distracting about it? Maybe something's too colorful. Maybe it's something regarding the layout. Maybe it's the ordering of elements, or the size or proportion of something related to something else. Maybe it's a specific animation. Maybe it's even a sound generated by a specific action, button press, or gesture. So what do you do? You look, you consider. But when you're staring at the thing that prompted the feedback, it's common to narrow your focus until only the offending element is in view. Essentially, when someone says 'it's this thing', it's only natural to look at *that thing*. It's no different than looking *over there* when someone points off into the distance. You adjust your gaze to meet their attention. At their direction, you're looking for *something at the expense of everything else.* But it's not the thing that matters here, it's the broader context. It's not the focus, it's the zoom. Something can be distracting bad (it makes it hard to focus on what really matters), or distracting good (it calls your attention to something you need to know about right now). And something can also be distracting in theory, and completely not in practice. There are many contexts, and you can't evaluate subjective design feedback without considering the whole context in which it exists. For example, today I was driving on the highway, weaving in and out of traffic trying to make up some time because I was running late (dumb, I know). In my car, one of the digital gauge cluster icons can be changed to a g-force indicator. It's a little dot that animates across a field in real time based on the g's you're pulling. Since I was weaving and changing directions, the dot was slamming from side to side. It looks something like this, except that you have to imagine the dot moving around as you're driving, not fixed in the middle as in this example: ![gforce.jpg](https://world.hey.com/jason/3b23e5cf/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTXdnUmlRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e495c07fa26683dcaec150dd560db525983c0ae0/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19 --0b5e092e6240e14fab357b4c1013c9a0c881ff87/gforce.jpg) Now, I can imagine a design review session where designers presented this idea and someone said 'a dot constantly moving around would be distracting for the driver.' If we view this in isolation, they'd have a point. Especially since we imagine the gauge cluster being in front of the driver. So on paper, yes, it certainly might be distracting. And even in an isolated simulation it could be distracting. And if you were staring at the element in the graphics or animation program where it was initially mocked up and conceived, it would probably be distracting \u2014 especially if you're watching a prototype animation endlessly loop. And if it was presented as a static image surrounded by annotated comments, then you could be convinced it was distracting. And if your head is full of review feedback about how distracting it could be, then it certainly may be hard to imagine it in any other way than distracting. But this gauge, and this animated dot, *isn't actually distracting* in practice. Turns out, the gauge cluster is in front of you, but it's below your field of vision. It's in your periphery. You aren't tracking it, and you don't notice it unless you look at it. In the context of driving, yes the dot is moving, but your eyes are fixed on motion *outside*. The road is moving, cars are moving, the landscape is moving, street signs are moving. And those movements are relatively huge compared to that tiny little dot. The big motion is what captures your attention. The dot doesn't distract. In fact, you don't even notice it unless you look. It can't win your attention unless you give it your attention. You are in control, the dot is not. Now this is an example from the automotive world. But this comes up in software design all the time. Mockups aren't real. Looking at screens or designs in isolation limits your ability to think about the whole system. Reducing elements to their objective qualities (size, color, etc) flattens them and removes the richness of the situation, the moment, the time, and the context in which they exist. The user isn't evaluating, *the user is using* for a reason, in a given context, with more going on in their world than just that element, that object, and that screen in front of them. All this is simply a reminder to resist the urge to focus in on isolated feedback. Rather, zoom out and look at the whole. Get real with it. Then consider.",

    "title": "Designing products: Fewer options, more optionality",
    "content": "Designing products is one of my favorite things to do \u2014 period. There's a lot to love. The twists and turns, the surprises, the creative explorations, the collaboration, and the moments when things really come together. But it's the practical choices, the tough decisions, and the tradeoffs that really make the work challenging and interesting. I'm long for that kind of work. When building products you're occasionally reminded of a peculiar \u2014 somewhat magical \u2014 irony: That reducing options can create more optionality. And that you can actually do less work and get more out of it. Case in point. We're currently working on adding autoresponders to HEY. Since these are frequently used by people who are going out of town, we began the flow with specifying a start and end date. If anyone emails you between these two dates, we'll auto-respond with some text you've written in advance. This is basically how most autoresponders work. But one of our rules around here is that we're always aiming to get something working within the first week of working on it. Not mockups, but HTML+CSS hooked up to backend code that works and does something for real. It's a healthy exercise that forces you into discovering the epicenter, and figuring out the essence of the idea where the bulk of the value resides. So what does someone need to set up an autoresponder that responds while you're gone for a while? It's not actually a date range, it's simply an on or off switch. Dates turn the autoresponder on or off, but so would a simple, single on/off toggle. Want your autoresponder on? Flip the switch. Want it off when you return? Flip the switch. One toggle switch is all you need to get this working. It's also the fastest way to get this working. This is when the magic happens. A simple switch eliminates all sorts of work, edge cases, error states, etc. When you set dates, you have to account for potential error states. The start date could be after the end date. Or the date format you enter could be wrong. Or what if you entered the same date for start and end? Or what if you leave one date field blank but fill in the other? There's much to account for, and accounting for all those things requires work, hidden states, contingency design (designing for when things go wrong), additional QA testing, etc. The on/off binary is better. It's clearer, easier, more flexible, and fewer things can go wrong. On/off gives you something else too: The freedom to not have to know when you're returning. On = out for as long as you're out. This unlocks another use case: The perpetual autoresponder. Some people prefer an autoresponder whenever someone emails them. They essentially use it as a README \u2014 laying down the rules of email engagement. We initially considered a perpetual autoresponder as a separate feature, but when you simplify into on/off, on = away for now or always and forever. You get two for one, it's up to you. So that's where we're starting. On/off. And it's likely where we're ending. By eliminating options we've simplified the product, reduced the potential for errors or confusion, and we also got a perpetual autoresponder feature for free. Fewer options, more optionality. Easier to build, easier to use, more flexibility, and faster to ship. Simplifying can give you all sorts of leverage. Addition by subtraction. We'll take it. About Jason Fried Hey!

    "title": "How We Acquired hey.com",
    "content": "As more and more people discover our new email service, \u2014 Back on June 9, 2018, I cold emailed HEY.com, I continue to get questions about how we acquired the domain name. While I can't tell you how much it cost, I can share the story behind the acquisition process. Here goes:\u2014 Back on June 9, 2018, I cold emailed help@hey.com:Hey there\u2013 Curious\u2026 Would you entertain an offer to sell hey.com? I'd like to use it for something I'm working on, and willing to make you a strong offer. Let me know. Thanks! -Jason And that\u2019s where it all began. For the 25+ years I\u2019ve been emailing, I\u2019d say close to 95% of those email began with some variation of \u201cHey [Name]\u201d. So when it came time to think about a name for a new email system we\u2019d be building, HEY was a natural. Further, the \u201cHey!\u201d menu in Basecamp3 holds your notifications for new messages, chats, to-do assignments, automatic check-in prompts, boost summaries, and the like. So we already had some prior art on Hey being a place for communication.But hey.com \u2013 that would be an amazing email address, and, we rightly assumed, hard to get. But what the hell \u2013 if you don\u2019t ask you don\u2019t get, so I sent the email, crossed my fingers, and waited. The same day I emailed, June 9, 2018, he replied. Turns out we\u2019d actually talked before on This Week in Tech, way back when. This was his first email back to me: Hi Jason: Thanks for reaching out, I've always respected your business accomplishments and your writing. You may not remember but we spoke briefly a couple of times when I was at TWiT. As you might imagine, I've gotten a number of offers and inquiries about HEY.com over the years. Usually I ignore them, but very happy to chat with you about this or any other topic. I'm on cell at ###-###-####. Thanks! Dane So we set up a call and had a nice chat. Really nice guy. A few days later, I made an offer. He said no. So I countered. He said no. We were clearly way off. And the momentum went cold. He decided he wasn\u2019t ready to sell. I thanked him for the opportunity and said let\u2019s stay in touch. Then on August 19, 2019, well over a year after my initial outreach, he wrote me back. Hi Jason: Not sure if you're still interested in Hey.com, but I'm in the process of vetting what appears to be a serious inquiry to buy it. The numbers being discussed are notably higher than what you mentioned previously. Given your previous offer I'm thinking you probably won't be interested, but I appreciated your approach andalso what you've done for the industry, so I thought I'd let you know as a courtesy. We caught up via Zoom a few days later, discussed again, and I made another offer. This time significantly higher than our original offer. It was a nervous amount of money. Things were beginning to heat up, but there was no deal yet. I completely understood \u2013 he owned this domain for a long time, and he wasn\u2019t a squatter. Dane used hey.com for his business. It was part of his identity. It was a valuable asset. He needed time to think it through. We traded a number of other emails, and then I upped the offer a little bit more on September 18, 2019. A few days later we\u2019d verbally agreed to move forward on an all-cash deal with a number of stipulations, conditions, etc. All were perfectly reasonable, so we asked him to prepare a contract. There were a few small back and forths, but we essentially accepted his contract and terms as is. We wired the money into escrow, we waited for some Google mail transfer stuff to finish up, and on November 20th, 2019 the domain was officially transferred over into our ownership. Funds were released to escrow, and the deal was done. This was a long 18 month process, and there was uncertainty at every step. We\u2019d never bought a domain like this, he\u2019d never sold a domain like this. There\u2019s a lot of trust required on all sides. And more than money, hey.com was important to him. And who he sold it to was important to him as well. But it was truly a pleasure to work with him. Dane was fair, thoughtful, patient, and accommodating. And for that we\u2019re grateful. Business deals like this can get messy, but this one was clean and straightforward. Kudos to him and his lawyer for their diligence and clear communication. All in we traded 60+ emails over the course of the deal. Toss in a few zoom calls as well. So that\u2019s the story of how we acquired hey.com. One cold email to kick it off, no domain brokers or middlemen, and a lot of patience and understanding on both sides. Wait how much was it? I know everyone wants to know, but we can\u2019t say. Both sides are bound by a non-disclosure around the final purchase price. You\u2019ll just have to guess. As for Dane, he relaunched his brand under a new name. You can check him out at VidiUp.tv.As for us, if you're curious what email could be like if a company that gave a damn about email actually put in the effort to make it markedly better, check out HEY.com.*Note: This post was cleared with Dane prior to publishing, so he\u2019s cool with me sharing his name, the story, and the name of his new company.*",

    "content": "2021 kicked off a new era for Basecamp. One of renewed ambition and a desire to excel on a variety of fronts, simultaneously. We're no longer just going all-in on something we make, we're going all-out on everything we do. To get there, David and I realized we needed a peer, someone who can help us run the business day-to-day, and think about the business year-to-year. So a few months back we began searching for a new COO. We've had someone in this role before, but the position has been conspicuously vacant for 5 years. This new COO would help us build a more capable company. To grow the business, and question core assumptions that planted us in the past, rather than push us into the future. We're pleased to report that after a long, thorough search, we were fortunate to find the perfect match. Her name is The search process was enlightening. Some of the candidates we spoke just weren't the right fit for us. Some you're really excited about at the start, but the excitement wanes the further along you get. Others start strong and keep getting stronger as you go. That was Elaine. The first time David and I talked to Elaine we thought \"Oh she's good, we want to talk with her again.\" Then we talked again and said \"She's really good\". The next call ended with \"She's great\". And when we met in person, things kept getting better. That's when we knew she was a lock. During the interview process we introduced her to a few other senior folks here, and they all felt the same way. That sealed the deal for us. Her experience was spot-on relevant, and we were impressed by how she approached various real-time scenarios we lobbed her way. It seemed like nothing phased her, which gave us a high degree of confidence she could handle the unknown and unpredictable. She wasn't afraid to disagree, and when she did, she always helped us see the concern from a different point of view. Her writing is both expressive and crystal clear, and our conversations were effortless, as if we worked together for a decade. Finally, her references drove home the point that Elaine always demonstrates honest care and concern for the people she works with. It kept lining up until it all lined up. One thing in particular Elaine is going to help with is developing leaders from within, and bringing in leadership from the outside to help grow groups and teams we've never had before. We'll finally be able to get to things we've had on the back burner for, in some case, years. This will also free people up who've been doing double duty in specific roles. The remainder of 2021 is about continuing to pump out excellent product updates for our Basecamp 4 and HEY customers, and putting the pieces in place to set the stage for significant growth in 2022. More leadership, dozens of new colleagues from all over the world, new teams, significant product improvements, and enhanced capabilities all wrapped up with a new sense of ambition and possibilities. In many ways we're starting over with a huge head start. And Elaine's expertise gives us another unfair advantage. Here we go.",

    "content": "On the 10th anniversary of Steve Jobs' passing, [Jony Ive reflected](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jony-ive-steve-jobs-memories-10th-anniversary-11633354769)on the man he worked with for nearly 30 years. It was a lovely remembrance, primarily orbiting the sanctity of the creative process and the burbling of ideas. It reminded me about something else Jony said about Steve in shortly after his death:\"And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood thatwhile ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.\" \u2014Jonathan Ive That isn't a vapid business quote. Or Steve Jobs idolatry. It's just plain fucking true. It's so easy to lather up with scrutiny. To inject a full dose of doubt into an incipient idea that was on the inside just a moment before. There's nothing particularly constructive about knocking something new, rushing to point out the problems, demanding immediate justification, or convincing yourself it simply won't work. It's so tempting to do, especially because you're almost always guaranteed to be right that it's wrong. The hard thing is to make room for what *may*be possible. To help it unfurl. To encourage emergence, to explore, to expand. To be part of the soil that helps something blossom. To wonder what could be before it can be. To simply give something a chance before smashing it to bits. Expecting a new idea to come out fully formed would be like asking a newborn baby to explain itself. You wouldn't assume a blank stare, shrill cry, and complete bewilderment means it'll never amount to anything. But with new ideas \u2014 often just ebbing echos of a freeform riff \u2014 that's a common presumption. It's not the creative moment, it's the creative *process*\u2014 a series of layered events, similar to baking a cake. Doubt and skepticism are part of the recipe, but if you mix them in at the wrong time, things won't come together. Of course ideas eventually need to stand up for themselves, to resolve, to be viable. But not 5 minutes in. Ideas \u2014 especially unconventional ones \u2014 are such defenseless, easy targets. Medieval towns without walls. Snails without shells. Which brings me to improv. Something I've never done, but deeply admire. Improv practices a potent form of protectionism that primes the pump for possibilities. At the root of improv is the clever concept of \"Yes, And\". \"Yes, And\" creates an ally. It forces a partner to avoid rejection, and, instead, find a flow. To go with it, to work with it, to run with it. The primary aim is to make it work, and see what that work makes. It's not one against the other, it's both for co-creation. It's a framework for building something up, not shutting something down. \"Yes, And\" fuels the creative process and protects the fledgling spark. It's the code for curiosity. Let's see where it goes, rather than assume we already know where it'll end up. And like many improv skits, things don't always end up working out. Some ideas just peter out, or wander towards worse. They're \"Yes, Anded\" all the way to Not Funny. It happens, frequently! When talking ideas, the time will *always*come for \"Now What?\" Or \"How Then?\" Or \"Yeah, But\". And likely, eventually, \"Hell No\". At some point, justification is *required*, as it should be. But don't start there. Create a vacuum early, otherwise apprehension rushes in. There are few things as deeply satisfying \u2014 as thirst quenching \u2014 as partners who know when the \"Yes, And\" rules apply, collectively finding their way towards something unknown, promising, and inspiring, together. \"A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it is not open.\" \u2014Frank Zappa",

    "title": "Is there a difference between building a business or building a company?",
    "content": "They've always seemed synonymous \u2014 interchangeable \u2014 to me, but now I think there's a difference. We just completed the search process for a new COO at Basecamp. It's essentially a brand new position at the company. We had a COO for one year about five years ago, but for the rest of our 22 year existence, we haven't had someone in that position. The only two C-level executives at Basecamp (and 37signals before that) have been me and David. We're deficient in Vitamin C. Aside from exposing us to a number of smart people we'd never have met on our own, the search also carved out a wonderful space to reflect. Reflect on what we've built over the last 22 years, how we've built it, and where we want to go next. In that reflection I spotted a reality I hadn't really considered. We've built an outstanding Why was this new to me? As Orwell said, to see what's in front of one\u2019s nose needs a constant struggle. We've leaned on a formula with just a few ingredients \u2014 strong products, strong opinions, strong word of mouth growth, and strong individual contributors. While hundreds of smart, autonomous decisions are made by people doing the work, and valuable contributions come from all corners, David and I are the only two tasked with thinking strategically about the company itself. That feels flimsy. If nothing else, two people who see many things the same way inherently lack perspective. That view can still get you far, but how much further could we go with a wider point of view coming from a dozen distributed eyes, rather than four centralized ones? So as part of hiring our COO, we're going to begin investing significantly on developing leaders from within, and bringing in structural leadership from the outside. More people with an executive mindset to complement our outstanding crew of individual contributors. And we'll build out a few new dedicated groups and departments that were perviously handled on borrowed time by people already responsible for doing other jobs. Further, we're going invest in other forms of resiliency and redundancy throughout the company. Historically we've run Basecamp with an eye towards efficiency. We've run exceptionally lean, and to great effect. But running on 3% body fat forever isn't healthy over the long term. We need more It'll take some time, we'll bump into obstacles we can't yet see, certain setups will turn out to be setbacks, but it all starts with a commitment to improve. All this is to say we're about to rework ourselves into a more capable company. One that's doing more, in parallel, rather than sequentially. One that doesn't balance on a couple points, but rather one that's supported by a grid of columns. Swipe a leg, the others keep us standing. Stable, resilient, and distributed. Stronger. I never looked forward to building a bigger company. Reflexively, I've always wanted to keep thing as small as possible. Like an instinct I knew by heart, baked in by hearing myself say it \u2014 and think it \u2014 over and over. But my mind has been changed, and I'm looking forward to turning the page and digging into the next chapter. Here we go.",

This was an aesthetic exercise \u2014 aiming to find a better balance of leaves, branches, light, shadow, density, open space, shape, etc. Part of this process was also getting rid of suckers, crossing branches, and limiting general verticality. We wanted the trees to look more relaxed and open, while feeling natural, not manicured. It's active, iterative, and hugely satisfying work. While we were cutting branches, I noticed him reaching down into the soil and smudging the cut ends with soil. \"What's that about?\" I asked. \"Ah, this helps hide the bright cuts so they don't stand out,\" he said. Smudging some soil on the cut wood helps mellow the color of the exposed wood and blend it into the surrounding darker bark. It was purely aesthetic, and temporary, but it was definitely an improvement. It lent itself well to the aim of making things feel natural. Bright bare spots didn't feel natural. It was a trick of the trade. For as long as I can remember, I've loved tricks of the trades \u2014 little things, gleaned through experience, that only people in the know, know.

Hope you enjoy these. \u2014 Heard Something This conversation between Peter Attia and Katherine Eban about widespread fraud in the generic drug industry was a real eye opener. When it comes to prescription drugs, you kinda assume all generics are the same, and equally effective, but... Well, wow, just listen. Hear it: https://peterattiamd.com/katherineeban/ Read Something Takanakuy, which means \u201cto hit each other\u201d in Quechua (the Indigenous language spoken in the Peruvian Andes), is a tradition specific to Peru\u2019s Chumbivilcas Province. Rural communities up in the Andes Mountains, many of which don't have access to traditional law enforcement to resolve disputes, settle their scores once a year in a public arena, with their fists. Read it: https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/travel/takanakuy-fighting-festival-peru.html Saw Something Incredible animations that begin as match sticks and end as... Well, wow, just watch. Endlessly creative, such a joy to witness all the permutations of someone's imagination (and to sit in awe of someone's ability to execute).

And remember, we already like this person *a ton*otherwise they wouldn't have progressed this far, so many of these questions are trying to suss out some of the limitations and blindspots we may not have noticed during the formal interview process.- What's something that would surprise us about them? \\- Specifically, any areas where you were surprised they weren't as good as you expected with A, B, or C? Or much better than expected with D, E, and F? \\- What's the difference between how they interview and how they deliver on the job? \\- Is there a difference between how a boss, a peer, or a direct report would describe them? If so, what's the difference? \\- If you were at another company, would you absolutely hire this person again for a similar role? \\- Who do they naturally gravitate to inside an organization? Or naturally avoid? \\- What are they better at than they think, and, on the flip side, worse at than they think? \\- What sort of things do they do that often go unnoticed or are under-appreciated? \\- What don't they get enough credit for? \\- Can you tell me about the kind of people *they've*hired? - Do they leave disagreements on good terms? \\- Are they more curious or critical about what they don't understand? \\- What's the one thing nearly everyone would say about them? \\- What kind of company feels like a natural fit? And which kind would be a challenge? \\- Can you describe a time when they changed their mind? From what to what, and what caused the change? \\- What's the best thing about working with them? And the hardest? \\- If you could change something about them, what would it be? \\- Are they better working with what they have, or working with what they want? \\- When have you seen them get in over their head? And how did that turn out? \\- Have you seen them get better at something? Worse? \\- Do they make other people better? How? \\- Are they better at taking credit or giving credit? \\- Are they more likely to adjust to something, or try to adjust the thing? \\- Primary blindspot? And bright spot? \\- As well as you know this person, what do you think their secret career ambition is? \\- If they hadn't been at your company, how would your company have been different? \\- Can you remember a time you wished you had their advice on a decision, but you didn't? \\- Have they ever changed your mind? \\- What's the easiest thing for them to communicate? And the hardest? \\- How have they changed during the time you knew them? \\- Do you still keep in touch even though you don't work together anymore? \\- What do they need to be successful? \\- Why do you think we'd be a better company with them on board? \\- Who else should I talk to that would have something to say about them? There are many more, but those are among the things I'm most curious about.

    "title": "The Difference Between Time and Attention",
    "content": "A few years ago I realized that if I\u2019m too busy to take something on, I shouldn\u2019t say \u201cI don\u2019t have the time\u201d. In fact, I often do have the time. It\u2019s not that hard to squeeze in some extra time for someone. What I don\u2019t have \u2013 and what I can\u2019t squeeze in \u2013 is more attention. Attention is a far more limited resource than time. So what I should say is \u201cI don\u2019t have the attention\u201d. I may have 8 hours a day for work, but I probably have 4 hours a day for attention. One summer, a guy wrote me out of the blue asking if he could intern for me. His email was great \u2013 clear, thoughtful, kind, inviting, confident but not pushy, and not too long (but long enough to say what he had to say without leaving anything out). He was studying at Harvard Business School and was going to be back in Chicago that summer. He asked if he could swing by and say hi. His email made it easy for me to say yes. So he did, and we had a great session. We spent maybe an hour or so together. I learned about his background, what kind of stuff he was interested in, what he wanted to learn, what he could teach us, etc. Then we riffed on a few ideas. It was natural, flowing, effortless. Really promising. Then I told him I\u2019d think a few things over and get back to him soon. He checked in a few weeks later, and I said I\u2019d get back to him soon again. And I didn\u2019t. A month or so after that I wrote him and told him I was really sorry. I\u2019d mislead him \u2013 and myself \u2013 thinking I had enough time to take on a intern that summer. I wanted to, I really liked him, I thought he\u2019d be great, but I just didn\u2019t have as much time as I thought I had to even consider it more and line up work and spend time with him, etc. But really, as I thought about it, I realized I had the time. Every day is the same 24 hour cycle. Every workday around 8 hours. Surely I could have found even 20 minutes a day to work with him. But it wasn\u2019t that. It wasn\u2019t that I couldn\u2019t find the time. I couldn\u2019t find the *attention*\u2014 especially *sustained* attention. My mind fills up with a few key projects and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m absorbed by those. That\u2019s where my attention is. Had I made 20 minutes here and there for him, I\u2019d be physically present in that moment, but mentally I\u2019d be elsewhere. And that\u2019s not fair to either of us. Time and attention aren\u2019t the same thing. They're barely related.",

    "content": "How often have you heard that? Or said it yourself? Probably too often. For many, \u201cit\u2019s crazy at work\u201d has become their normal. But why's that? At the root is an onslaught of physical and virtual real-time distractions slicing work days into a series of fleeting work moments. Tie that together with a trend of over-collaboration, plus an unhealthy obsession with unprofitable growth at any cost, and you\u2019ve got the building blocks for an anxious, crazy mess. It\u2019s no wonder people are working longer, earlier, later, on weekends, and whenever they have a spare moment. People can\u2019t get work done at work anymore. Work claws away at life. Life has become work\u2019s leftovers. The doggy bag. The remnants. The scraps. That\u2019s just not OK. It\u2019s unacceptable. What\u2019s worse is that long hours, excessive busyness, and lack of sleep have become a badge of honor for many people these days. Sustained exhaustion is not a badge of honor, it\u2019s a mark of stupidity. Companies that force their crew into this bargain are cooking up dumb at their employees\u2019 expense. And it\u2019s not just about organizations \u2014 individuals, contractors, and solopreneurs are burning themselves out the very same way. You\u2019d think with all the hours people are putting in, and all the promises of tech\u2019s flavor of the month, the load would be lessening. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s getting heavier. But the thing is, there\u2019s not more work to be done all of the sudden. The problem is there\u2019s hardly any uninterrupted, dedicated time to do it. Working more but getting less done? It doesn\u2019t add up. But it does \u2014 it adds up to a majority of time wasted on things that don\u2019t matter. Many modern companies seem to be great at one thing: wasting. Wasting time, attention, money, energy. Out of the 60, 70, 80 hours a week many are expected to pour into work, how many of those hours are really spent on the work itself? And how many are tossed away in meetings, lost to distraction, and withered away by inefficient business practices? The bulk. The answer isn\u2019t more hours, it\u2019s less bullshit. Less waste, not more production. And far fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety, and stress. Stress is an infection passed down from organization to employee, from employee to employee, and then from employee to customer. And it\u2019s becoming resistant to traditional treatments. The same old medicine is only making it worse. And remember, stress can not be contained. It never stops at the edge of work. It always bleeds into life. It infects your relationships with your friends, your family, your kids. The promises keep coming. More time management hacks. More ways to communicate. More information spread across separate platforms and disparate places. New demands to pay attention to more and more real-time conversations happening all the time at work. Faster and faster, for what? Panaceas left and right. Snake oil. On-demand is for movies, TV shows, and podcasts, not for you. Your time isn\u2019t an episode recalled when someone wants it at 10pm on a Saturday night, or every few minutes in the collection of conveyor belt chat room conversations you\u2019re supposed to be following all day long. If it\u2019s constantly crazy at work, we have two words for you: Fuck that. And two more: Enough already. \u2014 \u2014 Adapted from our latest mass-market book, \"It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work.\" The Economist called it \"funny, well-written and iconoclastic and by far the best thing on management published this year.\"",

Work at the office a few days a week, work remotely the other days. In general I think that's a fair approach for a lot of companies. But it's not Remote work means working from anywhere.

Nothing wrong with a work from home situation, but it's not remote working. Beware companies that call it remote work if there are office visits attached.

    "title": "The Missed Opportunity of Rental Car Companies",
    "content": "Every time I get off a plane and head to the rental car counter, I'm surprised by what I see. Hertz, Avis, National, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Alamo, etc. What I'd expect to see: Audi, BMW, Tesla, Volkswagen, Mercedes, Lexus, Cadillac, Ford, Volvo, Porsche, Hyundai, Land Rover, etc. I know you can rent those cars from the rental car companies, but not having the brands representing themselves seems like a missed opportunity. The other issue with trying to rent a specific brand from a rental company is that rental companies rarely guarantee exact cars. Especially with the huge rental car shortage these days. I can't imagine a better way to try out a car prior to buying it than renting it on a trip. If it's a vacation or an important business trip \u2014 I'm already feeling good about it. Transfer those good feels, and special memories to the car \u2014 it'll make me want one even more. Let's say I'm thinking of buying a Volvo XC90. The Volvo dealer will only let me test drive the thing, and that's just a few miles with them in the passenger seat with me. It literally feels like a test, with them as the proctor. But if I land in Tucson, and need a car for a few days, what a great opportunity for Volvo to hook me as a customer. Let me rent an XC90 at the airport from the Volvo kiosk. The brand gets to control how they're represented, they get to present the car the way they want, and they get to send me off with a brand-sanctioned experience. They even get me to pay to try out their car! And happily, I might add. Another thing... I may just like driving Audis and I want to drive an Audi wherever I go. I'm comfortable with how they drive, and, when visiting new cities with unknown streets, every degree of comfort behind the wheel leads to a greater feeling of safety and brand affinity. As an Audi customer, you'd think Audi would prefer to have me in an Audi than for me to find myself admiring a Mercedes from behind the wheel. I've found myself in that exact situation before. I know Audi has sorta gone down this road with Hertz, Avis, National, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Alamo, etc. What I'd expect to see: Audi, BMW, Tesla, Volkswagen, Mercedes, Lexus, Cadillac, Ford, Volvo, Porsche, Hyundai, Land Rover, etc. I know you can rent those cars from the rental car companies, but not having the brands representing themselves seems like a missed opportunity. The other issue with trying to rent a specific brand from a rental company is that rental companies rarely guarantee exact cars. Especially with the huge rental car shortage these days. I can't imagine a better way to try out a car prior to buying it than renting it on a trip. If it's a vacation or an important business trip \u2014 I'm already feeling good about it. Transfer those good feels, and special memories to the car \u2014 it'll make me want one even more. Let's say I'm thinking of buying a Volvo XC90. The Volvo dealer will only let me test drive the thing, and that's just a few miles with them in the passenger seat with me. It literally feels like a test, with them as the proctor. But if I land in Tucson, and need a car for a few days, what a great opportunity for Volvo to hook me as a customer. Let me rent an XC90 at the airport from the Volvo kiosk. The brand gets to control how they're represented, they get to present the car the way they want, and they get to send me off with a brand-sanctioned experience. They even get me to pay to try out their car! And happily, I might add. Another thing... I may just like driving Audis and I want to drive an Audi wherever I go. I'm comfortable with how they drive, and, when visiting new cities with unknown streets, every degree of comfort behind the wheel leads to a greater feeling of safety and brand affinity.

Hope you enjoy these. Heard Something I've always enjoyed listening to Mark Cuban interviews. He's freewheeling, opinionated, optimistic, future-focused, and doesn't hold back. He's just not worried, and I like listening to those kind of people, no matter what they have to say. In this episode of Honestly, Bari Weiss asks Mark about taxes, China, crypto, capitalism, and a whole lot more. It's a fun one.

    "title": "The Importance of a Broad Customer Base",
    "content": "If you have a small handful of customers paying you significantly more than most of your customers, you\u2019re no longer a product company \u2014 you\u2019re actually a consulting company working for those big payers. You\u2019ll do what they say \u2014 often at the detriment of your smaller customers \u2014 because the big companies pay the big bucks. And if you don\u2019t follow their money with your effort, an exodus of just one or two big customers could seriously impact your bottom line. It could put you at major risk. You don't want a customer you can't afford to lose. So instead we take the other approach \u2014 a broad customer base where nearly everyone pays us roughly the same amount per month, all things considered. We don't play favorites. For example, Basecamp is $99/month flat, no matter how many users you have. Have 250 users? Or just 3? It's still just $99/month total. What's that? It's a picture of our business in a random year \u2014 2017, to be specific. Each dot represents the lifetime $billings of a single Basecamp account. See how uniform that is? It looks like static. Static is a healthy business. No outliers, no major splotches. If you removed any one dot \u2014 or even any 10, 20, or 100 dots \u2014 you\u2019d barely notice. You could probably remove 1000 random dots and it would still look the same. You know what else it looks like? Insulation. Because it is insulation \u2014 insulation from risk. Of course we wouldn\u2019t want this to happen, but because our revenue is so equally distributed across a large number of independent customers, if a random 10% of our customers left tomorrow, we\u2019d be a smaller business, but we'd also be predictably ok. We\u2019d never have to cross our fingers and hope that \u201cCustomer X that pays us 100x more than the average customer\u201d wasn\u2019t part of that 10%. If you mapped your customers like this, what would your your chart look like? If you started pulling away your 10 biggest customers, would you see big gaps, or would the holes be swallowed up by the whole? Would it be obvious with a few removed or would you be able to even tell the difference? Are you diversified or dangerously dedicated to a few big bets? Some special customers, or all special customers? We'll take all. -Jason",

    "content": "Lately I've been making it a habit to occasionally listen to podcasts from about a year ago. I scroll back in time until I find one that's about this same date from 2020 and hit play. And I have the inventory, another 12 months back to 2019. Last year at this time we were smack dab in the middle of COVID, a pivotal political campaign in the US, and a few weeks past the murder of George Floyd. There was much prognostication. As you can imagine, there were a lot of experts on a lot of podcasts in June 2020. There was a lot to talk about. Listening back now, you notice something from before: Experts are confident, but their predictions often miss the mark. They're just like you and me \u2014 they have flawed, biased, human opinions. They reason emotionally. They're informed by their present circumstance, and filled with historical reference, but everything forward looking is a guess. Some guess better than others, but on reflection you hear a lot of false confidence about what's actually happening, what's possible, where things are heading, and what's going to change. I don't listen to hold anything against anyone, or to play gotchya. I had no idea either. I listen as a reminder to be less certain. Less sure. No one really knows in the moment. We should know that. With so much information flying by, with so many opinions crackling in our ears, it's usually If you really want to know, you really have to wait. Try it sometime. Next time your podcast app says there's a new episode, ignore it, scroll back to this time last year, and play that one.

As we begin reviewing some candidates, I reminded that one of the biggest challenges when hiring someone is trying to envision their potential. Sometimes someone\u2019s a sure bet. Their pedigree is exceptional, their portfolio is stocked with amazing work, their experience is vast, they\u2019re a confident interview, and everything just feels perfect. They're obvious. It happens, but that\u2019s not how it usually works. There are very few perfect people. Instead there\u2019s a lot of future perfect people. People who have the potential to become the perfect person in the perfect role if just given the right opportunity. When I hire designers, I'll of course take a perfect person now, but I really enjoy looking for future perfect people. Some people have the potential, but they haven\u2019t had the opportunities. Their portfolios are full of mediocre work, but it\u2019s not because they\u2019re mediocre designers. It\u2019s because they\u2019ve been given mediocre opportunities. Sometimes designers are held back by onerous process. Other times they're held back by a client. Other times they're held back by business constraints. Other times their days are fragmented by meetings, and they simply don't have the time to dig into uninterrupted hours of deep creative work. Other times their work is focus-grouped to death. Other times their work is great when delivered, but diluted by future changes out of their control. Other times their most interesting designs are quashed by a management team that's afraid to step outside the mainstream. Other times they may do excellent work, but the final decision makers have something else in mind. While it\u2019s a bonus to find that perfect person today, I love betting on people with potential. When they finally get that chance to do their best work, they blossom in such a special way. There's nothing like it.

The one on my wrist can tell me the time (precisely in 12 hour format, roughly in 24), the day of the week, the month of the year, which year of the leap year cycle we\u2019re in, and the current moon phase. But that\u2019s its limit. There\u2019s no software, only hardware. It\u2019s programmed in springs and gears and levers and jewels. The one in my pocket can tell me anything and do just about everything. It knows my voice, it responds to my touch, and it even instantly recognizes my face. This machine even knows the angle, velocity, and distance it travels when I swing it around. And it always knows exactly where it is anywhere on the planet. But sometimes I wonder which one is more modern. The one in my pocket can do more, but only for a limited time. And then it can\u2019t do anything. It dies unless it can drink electrons from a wall through a cable straw for some hours every day. And in a few years it\u2019ll be outdated. In ten years it might as well be 100 years old. Is something that ages so fast ever actually modern? And then there\u2019s the machine on my wrist. It\u2019s powered entirely by human movement. No batteries, no cables, no daily dependency on the outside world. As long as I\u2019m running, it\u2019s running. And as long as one person checks it out once a decade, it\u2019ll be working as well in 100 years as it works today. It\u2019s better than modern. It\u2019s forever. As time goes by, my pocket will meet many machines. My wrist might too. But when I look down at the machine on my wrist today, and know that in 50 years my son will be able to look down at his wrist at the same machine ticking away the same way it ticks today. That\u2019s a special kind of modern reserved for a special kind of machine: the wonderful mechanical wristwatch.",

Hope you enjoy these. Heard Something I enjoyed listening to Sam Harris spend 20 minutes describing the fundamentals of his recent mushroom trip. He took 5 grams with a blindfold on in a therapeutic, guided setting. Sam's recollection and observations were simultaneously a wonderfully recited reminder of a similar experience I had (sans jaguar), and also a model example of why words \u2014 even perfectly placed ones \u2014 are dull, incompatible surrogates for what can only be directly experienced.

It's a translated collection of Epictetus' fundamental teachings, and perhaps the most useful 60-quick pages I've found anywhere.

    "title": "The Calm Company: Basecamp's Approach to Remote Work and Productivity",
    "content": "As a general rule, nobody at Basecamp really knows where anyone else is at any given moment. Are they working? Dunno. Are they taking a break? Dunno. Are they at lunch? Dunno. Are they picking up their kid from school? Dunno. Don\u2019t care. The vast majority of the time, it just doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is letting people design their own schedule around when they can do their best work. This is not nearly as hard as it sounds. But it does require a shift in mindset. Away from \u201cI have to call Jeff into a meeting *now* to get his take on this new feature idea\u201d to \u201cI\u2019ll write up my feature idea for Jeff to check-out whenever he has some free time, and then, maybe, we can have a chat about it live *later*, if needed. If you\u2019re constantly pulling people into things, then yeah, where they are *right now* matters. But if you prefer to let people consider something fully, and get back to you when *when they\u2019re ready*, then it doesn\u2019t matter where they are right now. We choose the latter. We\u2019ve always worked like this at Basecamp. Since we\u2019ve always been a remote company with people spread out all over the world, we\u2019ve been *forced* to work this way. We learned to appreciate the benefits of working asynchronously quickly as we collaborated over seven time zones right from the start. But it wasn\u2019t until we gave up on Presence that we really got to embrace the complete sense of calm that comes from not caring about when someone is working (or not) or where someone is (or isn\u2019t) at this very moment. Presence is a feature of many modern communication work tools. It\u2019s generally represented by a green, red, or yellow dot. If there\u2019s a green dot next to someone\u2019s name it means they\u2019re available. Yellow or red means they\u2019re away. This is how many companies get a read on who\u2019s working when. For years we used an internal instant messaging system that broadcasted everyone\u2019s real-time status. It seemed cool, it seemed useful. It seemed like something that would be good to know. But it turned out to be TMI: Too Much Information. Because, really, what does \u201cavailable\u201d and \u201caway\u201d really mean? Official definitions don\u2019t matter, because here\u2019s what they *actually* mean: \u201cAvailable to be bothered\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m running away and hiding because I can\u2019t get any fucking work done around here.\u201d Away, in particular, can be seen as bad form. Stay \u201caway\u201d (which most often actually means you\u2019re working, but don\u2019t want to be bothered) and people begin to question if you\u2019re at work at all. Leave \u201caway\u201d on too long and you\u2019re seen as unreliable. If you\u2019ve got presence on your work tools, you\u2019ve probably lived this very thing. What a joke, right? And \u201cavailable\u201d is usually just an invitation to be interrupted. Try being available for 3 hours, and then try being away for 3 hours. Bet you get more work done when you\u2019re marked away. Truth is, there are hardly any good reasons to know if someone\u2019s available or away at any given moment. If you truly need something from someone, ask them. If they respond, then you have what you needed. If they don\u2019t, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re ignoring you \u2014 it\u2019s because they\u2019re busy. Respect that! Assume people are focused on their own work. Are there exceptions? Of course. It might be good to know who\u2019s around in a true emergency, but 1% occasions like that shouldn\u2019t drive policy 99% of the time. And there are times where certain teams need to make sure someone\u2019s around so there are no gaps in customer service coverage, but those are specialized cases best handled by communication, not an ambiguous colored dot next to someone\u2019s name. These days at Basecamp we eschew status, we reject presence, we avoid abstraction. In fact, when designing the latest version of Basecamp, we deliberately decided to keep status and presence out of the product. We had it early on during the design process, but then we turned it off and we never missed it. The moment it was gone, a burden was lifted and things calmed down around here. So take a step towards calm, and relieve people from needing to broadcast their status. They\u2019ve got enough work to do \u2014 managing how they\u2019re presenting their availability to the company at large is an unnecessary burden. Everyone\u2019s status should be implicit: I\u2019m trying to do my job, please respect my time and attention.",

John was one of the original writers on 'The Simpsons', and the most prolific \u2014 he wrote 59 episodes. When you read the interview, you can see why the show was such a marvel.

David and I completely own the consequences, and we're sorry. We have a lot to learn and reflect on, and we will. The new policies stand, but we have some refining and clarifying to do. First, to our former colleagues: We know you'll go on to do great things. We wish you all the best. Your hard work and dedication over the years made Basecamp a better place. Thank you. We'll miss you, and we'll be rooting for you. Second, to our staff who remains with us: We know it's tough to see colleagues leave, and we're sorry we put you through that experience, but we deeply appreciate that you're sticking with us. We have a great team in place, and it's been wonderful and inspiring to see everyone helping one another, depending on each other, pitching in wherever they can, and supporting all our customers. A deep, heartfelt thanks. Third, to our customers: We're here and we remain committed to supporting you today, tomorrow, and in the long run. The day-to-day responsibilities of running a company do not stop. Our Technical Operations and Customer Support teams continue to ensure all our products are running smoothly, support requests are being answered, and new customer signups continue as usual.

    "content": "At Basecamp, we treat our company as a product. It's not a rigid thing that exists, it's a flexible, malleable idea that evolves. We aren't stuck with what we have, we can create what we want. Just as we improve products through iteration, we iterate on our company too. Recently, we've made some internal company changes, which, taken in total, collectively feel like a full version change. It deserves an announcement. In the product world, not all changes are enjoyed by all customers. Some changes are immediately appreciated. Some changes take time to steep, settle in, and get acquainted with. And to some, some changes never feel quite right \u2014 they may even be deal breakers. The same is true when changing your company, except that the customers are the employees. And when you get to a certain count \u2014 customers or employees or both \u2014 there's no pleasing everyone. You can't \u2014 there are too many unique perspectives, experiences, and As Huxley offers in Heavy, yes, but insightful, absolutely. A relevant reminder. We make individual choices. We all want different somethings. Some slightly different, some substantially. Companies, however, must settle the collective difference, pick a point, and navigate towards somewhere, lest they get stuck circling nowhere. With that, we wanted to put these directional changes on the public record. Historically we've tried to share as much as we can \u2014 for us, and for you \u2014 so this transmission continues the tradition. This may look like compression. A reduction, an elimination. And it is. It's precisely that. We're compressing X to allow for expansion in Y. A return to whole minds that can focus fully on the work we choose to do. A return to a low-ceremony steady state where we can make decisions and move on. A return to personal responsibility and good faith trust in one another to do our own individual jobs well. A return to why we started the company. A return to what we do best. Who's responsible for these changes? David and I are. Who made the changes? David and I did. These are our calls, and the outcomes and impacts land at our doorstep. Input came from many sources, disagreements were heard, deliberations were had. In the end, we feel like this is the long-term healthy way forward for Basecamp as a whole \u2014 the company and our products. When you've been around 20 years, you've been through change. You're used to it, and comfortable with it. These changes are part of a continuum in the experiment of independence that is Basecamp (and 37signals before that). We'll eventually run headlong into big change again. This is what we've done, and this is what we'll do \u2014 time guarantees it. We're very much looking forward to this new version of the company. Once the construction site is cleaned up, and the dust settles, we believe we'll see a refocused, refreshed, and revitalized Basecamp. Here we go, again.",

    "title": "The Illusion of Valuation",
    "content": "A few years back I was speaking to a class at a local university and the topic of valuations came up. One student asked me what our valuation was. I gave her the honest answer: I haven\u2019t a clue. Today I still don't. How is it possible that a successful software company today doesn\u2019t know what it's worth? A valuation is what other people think your business is worth. I\u2019ve only ever been interested in what our company is worth to us. Startups these days are bantered about as if they were in a fantasy football bracket. So and So raised $150 million at a $2.5 billion valuation? But This and That got tossed another $2.8 billion at a $41.2 billion valuation! Then there are the companies barely off the ground getting VC backing being valued at hundreds of millions \u2014 or even a billion \u2014 despite having no business model. Entrepreneurs by nature are competitive. But fundraising has become the sport in place of the nuts and bolts of building a sustainable business. Entrepreneurs by nature are competitive. But fundraising has become the sport in place of the nuts and bolts of building a sustainable business. The last time I considered Basecamp\u2019s valuation was nearly 15 years ago. At that point, we'd been approached by dozens of VC firms looking to invest. But with a solid product, a growing consumer base, and increasing profitability, we didn\u2019t entertain any offers. Then, in 2006, I got an email from Jeff Bezos\u2019s personal assistant. Jeff wanted to meet. I took the meeting. After a visit to Seattle and a few more calls, Jeff bought a small piece of our company. We didn\u2019t take the cash to turn Basecamp into something \u2014 we took risk off the table so we could keep it the same. In the years since, we\u2019ve been approached by literally hundreds of private investors, VCs, and private equity firms. They want to put money into our company, but we don\u2019t want it. It\u2019s not hubris; it\u2019s the cost that comes with the cash. I want to do what we want, no strings attached, no justification necessary. I want to grow our company according to our timetable, not one dictated by a board. For many startups, funding has worked to their detriment \u2014 unnecessarily raised stakes, a path to unnaturally rapid growth. Venture capital is not free money. Years ago, during the investment discussion with Jeff, we had to place a financial value on our company. The process of constructing a valuation was pretty silly, to be honest. We drew up charts, made some educated guesses, negotiated back and forth, and ultimately came up with a figure. We made it up, as everyone does. Let\u2019s just admit it right now: Financial projections are big, fat guesses. They are best-case scenarios. Since they\u2019re hypothetical, why not pull a number out of a hat? Jeff knows this. All investors know this. Yes, you can look at revenue and profit and multiples, but so many tech company projections these days aren\u2019t based on anything real. They\u2019re based on fantasy. And too often, the more profit you have, the lower your valuation is. Because nothing pops the valuation bubble like reality. My not knowing how much our company is worth doesn\u2019t affect our business on a daily basis. I just don't care to know \u2014 or even care at all. A valuation is an invented number that ebbs and flows on the basis of how much someone else thinks you\u2019re worth. It\u2019s nothing more than a distraction.",

What do I need to do to get from here to that amazing press release? All this super excitedness sets an unreasonable bar for every day work. Truth is, every day work is rarely exciting.

On balance the work should be rewarding, challenging, intellectually stimulating. Exciting is an outlier, an occasional experience. As it should be. Eat dessert all the time and what's for dessert? It's only really delicious when it's uncommon. So how do you keep people excited about the work all the time? You don't. How do you get them excited about the moment? A thing? An idea? The possibilities? A direction? The vision? The final package? That's the part worth investigating.",

    "content": "Traditional search engines like Google are pretty good at helping you find something specific. Like a research paper on a clinical trial, or a picture of Wrigley Field, or a product if you know the name. If you kinda know what you want, and you'll recognize it when you see it, there's a good chance that stodgy old search engine will help you find it. But sometimes you don't need something specific. You want something general. And you don't want to pick through thousands of text or images results to find the best result, when truly any result would do. And you don't want a link to the thing (where you aren't sure what you'll get when you get there), you simply want the thing. In that case, a sea of links is a tax on your time and attention, a moment of choice paralysis you don't need. Variety isn't always the spice of life \u2014 sometimes it's just too salty. For example, what if you just want a joke? Or a compliment? Or a poem? Or a cute animal pic? Not a specific one, just an example of a genre \u2014 and any example will do. I don't need thousands, I need one. And don't make me choose \u2014 you choose for me. Save me some time! Turns out, traditional search engines are kinda bad at that. And getting worse! Further, why assume the best place to deliver results is my browser? How about my email? So our H.E.R.L. (Hey Email Research Lab) team saw an opening.

What people are asking about is *certainty ahead of time*. But time doesn\u2019t start when you start working on something, or when you have a piece of the whole ready. It starts when the whole thing hits the market.How do you know if what you\u2019re doing is right while you\u2019re doing it? You can\u2019t be. You can only have a hunch, a feeling, a belief. And if the only way to tell if you\u2019ve completely missed the mark is to ask other people and wait for them to tell you, then you\u2019re likely too far lost from the start. If you make products, you better have a sense of where you\u2019re heading without having to ask for directions. There\u2019s really only one real way to get as close to certain as possible. That\u2019s to build the actual thing and make it actually available for anyone to try, use, and buy. Real usage on real things on real days during the course of real work is the only way to validate anything. And even then, it\u2019s barely validation since there are so many other variables at play. Timing, marketing, pricing, messaging, etc. Truth is, you don\u2019t know, you won\u2019t know, you\u2019ll never know until you know and reflect back on something real. And the best way to find out, is to believe in it, make it, and put it out there. You do your best, you promote it the best you can, you prepare yourself the best way you know how. And then you literally cross your fingers. I\u2019m not kidding. You can\u2019t validate something that doesn\u2019t exist. You can\u2019t validate an idea. You can\u2019t validate someone\u2019s guess. You can\u2019t validate an abstraction. You can\u2019t validate a sketch, or a wireframe, or an MVP that isn\u2019t the actual product. When I hear MVP, I don\u2019t think Minimum Viable Product. I think Minimum Viable Pie. The food kind. A slice of pie is all you need to evaluate the whole pie. It\u2019s homogenous. But that\u2019s not how products work. Products are a collection of interwoven parts, one dependent on another, one leading to another, one integrating with another. You can\u2019t take a slice a product, ask people how they like it, and deduce they\u2019ll like the *rest*of the product once you\u2019ve completed it. All you learn is that they like or don\u2019t like the slice you gave them.If you want to see if something works, make it. The whole thing. The simplest version of the whole thing \u2013 that\u2019s what version 1.0 is supposed to be. But make that, put it out there, and learn. If you want answers, you have to ask the question, and the question is: Market, what do you think of this completed version 1.0 of our product? Don\u2019t mistake an impression of a piece of your product as a proxy for the whole truth. When you give someone a slice of something that isn\u2019t homogenous, you\u2019re asking them to guess. You can\u2019t base certainty on that. That said, there\u2019s one common way to *uncertainty*: That\u2019s to ask one more person their opinion. It\u2019s easy to think the more opinions you have, the more certain you\u2019ll be, but in practice it\u2019s quite the opposite. If you ever want to be*less*sure of yourself,*less*confident in the outcome, just ask someone else what they think. It works every time.",

Nothing wrong with releasing organs, but we're enjoying the stem-celly who-knows-where-this-goes nature of HEY World right now. I'm well aware this is an imperfect analogy, but I'm OK with that. It's close enough to make me *think*, which is all that matters in my book.A stem cell is essentially an undifferentiated cell that can change \u2014 or differentiate \u2014 into various types of other cells, and, eventually, potentially, organs. A stem cell could eventually become a heart cell. Or a lung cell. Or a brain cell. Once it becomes *something else*, it stays that something else. It's now been defined, and limits are placed on what it can be, do, and become.When you put a new feature into a product, and out in the world, it can be partially developed or fully developed. The simpler, tighter, and smaller it is, the more stem-celly it is. The more full-featured, completely defined, it-can-do-a-dozen-things it is, the more organ-like it is. Take HEY World \u2014 the feature I'm using right now to publish this article. It's pretty stem-celly. It doesn't do much. I email [world@hey.com](mailto:world@hey.com)and this article shows up on the web so you can read it. That's pretty much all it does. And since it's so basic, so pure, it could eventually grow into all sorts of things. We have added basic newsletter functionality, but I can imagine a dozen different destinations for HEY World. You could add blogrolls, you could allow someone to create an aggregate blog with many different authors, you could allow people to move existing newsletters over from other services, you could sell access to exclusive content, you could print blogs into books, you could build an entirely different flow for responding to reader feedback, you could have templates, you could... You could build it into anything, eventually!That's the beauty of starting something so small, so fundamentally basic and unbounded from the start. It can grow, it can change, it can find its way into being whatever it eventually wants to be.

    "title": "The Myth of the Elevator Pitch",
    "content": "There\u2019s no shortage of lore about the importance of the elevator pitch. There\u2019s the 1850s version, in which inventor Elisha Otis\u2019s dramatic demonstration of his innovation \u2014 a safety brake that keeps elevators from falling during a cable failure \u2014 set a new bar for colorful, efficient salesmanship. There\u2019s the Hollywood version, in which writers pitching scripts have just 60 seconds to capture the imagination of producers. And then there\u2019s the rumored Jobsian one \u2014 if you worked for Apple and unluckily found yourself standing next to Steve Jobs in an elevator unable to describe your contributions to the company on that brief trip, you might have been sent packing. Today, the virtues of the elevator pitch have been codified by Silicon Valley. Get accepted to a startup accelerator and you\u2019ll be drilled in the art of the two-and-a-half-minute pitch \u2014 because that\u2019s all the time you\u2019ll have to sell your life\u2019s work to a potential investor. That\u2019s fucking ridiculous. The message this sends entrepreneurs is that success depends on your reducing your company\u2019s complex story to a few data points and sound bites. That\u2019s why you so often hear \u201cWe\u2019re the Uber of this\u201d or \u201cthe Warby Parker of that.\u201d Those are shortcuts leaning on people\u2019s preconceived notions of how some business in a different industry defines yours. If you have your own company but require another company to make your point, you\u2019re already headed in the wrong direction. For years, I\u2019ve struggled to come up with my Basecamp elevator pitch \u2014 a succinct description of our product, in standardized, universal terms. But recently I asked myself: Do I actually need one? When you struggle for so long with something, it\u2019s generally a good idea to question the purpose of your struggle. Does it matter anyway? Sure, in theory, the desire for a quick pitch seems reasonable. Who knows whom you might meet and how long you\u2019ll have to make your case? Now, play out some realistic scenarios. When have you ever had to explain your whole business in 20 seconds to someone who was truly motivated to understand what you do? Certainly, there are plenty of times when you are forced to bullet-point your vision to someone who really doesn\u2019t care, like a distant relative or a cab driver. But those who are genuinely curious about your business are willing to listen. It shouldn\u2019t take 10 minutes to explain it, but you don\u2019t need to jam your entire narrative into a couple of quick breaths. The rush of time is a false constraint. For me, context matters. Relying on a one-size-fits-all description of your business means missing an opportunity to engage people rather than just speak at them. Instead of blasting out your script, first show that you\u2019re curious about your audience. Ask them about themselves, what they do, what they struggle with. That\u2019s my approach. If I think Basecamp can be helpful, I define it in their context. I can cherry-pick something they\u2019ve told me and weave Basecamp in as a solution. People get what your company does not because of what you tell them it does, but because of how they see it fitting into their world and how it can benefit them personally. On any given day, I might describe Basecamp a dozen ways. Business owners and project managers have different needs for Basecamp. A freelancer with clients needs something different from someone who just works on internal projects. So ditch the elevator pitch. Taking time to understand someone can be much more powerful than perfecting an overly concise spiel for that mystery person in that mystery elevator.",

    "title": "The Wrong Way to Work Remotely",
    "content": "Back in the mid-90s, just as Netscape Navigator was giving us our first look at what the *visual*internet could be, web design came in two flavors.There was the ultra basic stuff. Text on a page, maybe a masthead graphic of some sort. Nothing sophisticated. It often looked like traditional letterhead, or a printed newsletter, but now on the screen. Interactions were few, if any, but perhaps a couple links tied a nascent site together. And there was the other extreme. Highly stylized, lots of textures, 3D-style buttons, page curls, aggressive shadows, monolithic graphics cut up with image maps to allow you to click on different parts of a single graphic, etc. This style was aped from interactive CD/DVD interfaces that came before it. Both of these styles \u2014 the masthead with text, and the heavily graphical \u2014 were *ports*. Not adaptations, but ports. Designs ported from one medium to another. No one knew what to make of the web at that time, so we pulled over things we were familiar with and sunk them in place. At that time, Web design wasn\u2019t web design \u2013 it was print design, multimedia/interactive design, and graphic design. It took years for native web design to come into its own.The web became great when designers started designing *for*the web, not bringing other designs*to*the web.Porting things between platforms is common, especially when the new thing is truly brand new (or trying to gain traction). As the Mac gained steam in the late 80s and early 90s, and Windows 3 came out in 1990, a large numbers of Windows/PC developers began to port their software to the Mac. They didn\u2019t write Mac software, they ported Windows software. And you could tell \u2013 it was pretty shit. It was nice to have at a time when the Mac wasn\u2019t widely developed, but, it was clearly ported. When something\u2019s ported, it\u2019s obvious. Obviously not right. Stuff that\u2019s ported lacks the native sensibilities of the receiving platform. It doesn\u2019t celebrate the advantages, it only meets the lowest possible bar. Everyone knows it. Sometimes we\u2019re simply glad to have it because it\u2019s either that or nothing, but there\u2019s rarely a ringing endorsement of something that\u2019s so obviously moved from A to B without consideration for what makes B, B. What we\u2019re seeing today is history repeat itself. This time we\u2019re not talking about porting software or technology, we\u2019re talking about porting a way to work. In-person office work is a platform. It has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some things are easier in person (meetings, if you\u2019re into those), and some things are harder (getting a few hours to yourself so you can focus, if you\u2019re into that). Remote work is another platform. It has its own unique flavor, advantages, and disadvantages. Its own efficiencies, its own quirks, its own interface. Upsides, downsides, insides, and outsides. It\u2019s as different from in-office work as the Mac is from Windows. Yes, they\u2019re both operating systems, and methods of computing, but they\u2019re miles apart where it matters. The same is true for the difference between in-office work and remote work. Yup, it\u2019s all still the same work, but it\u2019s a different *way*to work.In-office and remote work are different *platforms of work*. And right now, what we\u2019re seeing a lot of companies attempt to port local work methods to working remotely. Normally have four meetings a day in person? Then let\u2019s have those same four meetings, with those same participants, over Zoom instead. It\u2019s a way, but it\u2019s the wrong way.Simulating in-person office work remotely does both approaches a disservice. This is often what happens when change is abrupt. We bring what we know from one to the other. We apply what we\u2019re familiar with to the unfamiliar. But, in time, we recognize that doesn\u2019t work. The enlightened companies coming out of this pandemic will be the ones that figured out [the right way to work remotely](https://basecamp.com/books/remote). They\u2019ll have stopped trying to make remote look like local. They\u2019ll have discovered that remote work means more autonomy, more trust, more uninterrupted stretches of time, smaller teams, more independent, concurrent work (and less dependent, sequenced work).They won\u2019t be the ones that just have their waste-of-time meetings online, they\u2019ll be the ones that lay waste to the meetings. They won\u2019t be the ones that depend on checking in on people constantly throughout the day, they\u2019ll be the ones that give their employees time and space to do their best work. They won\u2019t be the ones that can\u2019t wait to pull everyone back to the office, they\u2019ll be the ones that spot the advantages of optionality, and recognize a wonderful resilience in being able to work from anywhere. And they\u2019ll be the ones that finally realize that there\u2019s nothing magical about the office. It\u2019s just a space where work *can*happen, but not where it*must*happen. Anytime a myth is busted is a good time.Work remotely, don\u2019t port the office. \u2014 \u2014 *Related reading:**The Basecamp Guide to Internal Communication**.* Related tooling:Related tooling: *Basecamp**.*",

Here's what it looks like right now: Foam, tape, shims, and glue \u2014 they're holding the whole thing together. It's the guts, the organs, the cartilage, and the bones to keep things lined up, and upright. On top of this game of Tetris, will float tight tolerances of metal and glass. Clean, crisp, and modern. Just like the brochure and proposal (but for twice the price and three times as long!). Whenever people talk about great companies \u2014 especially the enviable ones \u2014 I always remind them that if you peeled back the shiny brand, the fancy communications, and the slick surface layer, you'd see something similar to the picture above. Most businesses are held together with foam, tape, shims, and glue. Fragile supports, spontaneous structures, and stopgap methods to keep it all running. Scar tissue, unfinished edges, good intentions, legacy policies, and quite a few broken promises. Just enough to permit adequate progress to maintain an illusion of we got this. Plan all you want, we're all still figuring it out as we go. We prop it up, wedge it in, spin it around, feel for the center of gravity, and carefully release our grip while slowly stepping back to see if it balances on its own. This goes for your startup, and companies that have been around forever. Ones clearing nothing, and ones clearing a trillion. Not that there's ultimately anything wrong with that. Foam, tape, shims, and glue work! They're flexible, cheap, adaptable, universal, and do the job. They're the tools of the trade.

    "title": "Introducing HEY World",
    "content": "It wasn't for lack of things to say, observations to share, or opinions to float. It was primarily because setting up a personal blog was just too much of a hassle. It felt formal, it required yet another tool, yet another place to write, yet another platform to pay for just one feature. I had to pick a template, I had to think up a name, I had to make the relationship official. I didn't want any of that. I just wanted to write. It's amazing how complicated it remains \u2014 even in 2021 \u2014 just to get your simple thoughts down in text, on the web, at a permanent URL, for anyone in the world to see. Which is why Twitter has primarily been my publishing place of choice. Quick, short, easy. It's outstanding for that. Peerless. But it comes with increasingly undesirable downsides. Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Twitter's First Law of Tweeting states that for every tweet there's an unequal and opposite overreaction. Post something, and hear how you're wrong a dozen different ways. It's exhausting. I want to write, not fight. But beyond that, I simply want to share more considered, extended essays. Longer-form stuff. Even just a few paragraphs. Tweetstorms are fine \u2014 and they have their place \u2014 but they're really a hack for a multi-paragraph, complete thought on a single page. So I was thinking. Where do I write longer-form, single page stuff most often? When my co-workers are the audience, I always write in Basecamp. But when I want to send something detailed to someone else, anywhere else, it goes in an email. Email is the internet's oldest self-publishing platform. Billions of emails are \"published\" every day. Everyone knows how to do it, and everyone already can. The only limitation is that you have to define a private audience with everything you send. You've gotta write an email to: someone. So I thought, why not expand the possibilities here? Of course still let email be email, but what else could email be? When I write a certain kind of email \u2014 aka a blog post \u2014 why do I have to address it to someone? Why can't I just address my thoughts to the world? Direct to the web for anyone and everyone? Rather than define the recipients, I just write and let the recipients find me. Hmm! That might get me \u2014 and maybe many more \u2014 to (re)discover the joy of simply writing personal thoughts for public consumption. Sometimes you don't have to change the thing itself, but rather just make the thing considerably easier than it's ever been before. That's often the invitation you need to try something new, or jump back in again. So we set out to do it. To test the theory. And over the last few weeks we built it into HEY, our new email service. We're calling the feature HEY World. This post you're reading right now is the world's first HEY World post. And I published it by simply emailing this text directly to world@hey.com from my jason@hey.com account. That was it. For now, this remains an experiment. I've got my own HEY World blog, and David has his. We're going to play for a while. And, if there's demand, we'll roll this out to anyone with a personal @hey.com account. It feels like Web 1.0 again in all the right ways. And it's about time. Speaking of Web 1.0, HEY World pages are lighting fast. No javascript, no tracking, no junk. They're a shoutout to simpler times. Respect. As for me, I've been cataloguing a bunch of thoughts lately, waiting for the day where I could share them this easily. Now that publishing is as simple as sending an email, I plan on writing a lot. And, if you'd like to know when I publish something new, just enter your email address below and you'll get some of my favorites sent direct to you. Let's see how this turns out. Thanks for reading.

There are targets that would have been nice to hit, but if I didn\u2019t hit them I wouldn\u2019t look back and say I missed them. I don\u2019t aim for things that way. I do things, I try things, I build things, I want to make progress, I want to make things better for me, my company, my family, my neighborhood, etc. But I\u2019ve never set a goal. It\u2019s just not how I approach things. A goal is something that goes away when you hit it. Once you\u2019ve reached it, it\u2019s gone. You could always set another one, but I just don\u2019t function in steps like that. When you shift from 1st to 2nd, 1st is behind you. Then from 2nd to 3rd, 2nd is behind you. I approach things continuously, not in stops. I just want to keep going \u2014 whatever happens along the way is just what happens. I consider Basecamp, my current business, as one continuous line back from when I sold the first thing I ever remember making \u2014 a logo for $50 (which happened to be for Andrei Heramischuk \u2014 who knew!). I was 16 or something like that at the time. I didn\u2019t have a goal to make two logos, or to be able to charge $5000 for a logo. I just made logos. And then I made software. And then I made web sites. And now I make software again. No goals in the process that I remember.I just worked at whatever I was working on and ended up wherever I am. I continue to approach work and life that same way today. If I\u2019ve used the word goal, I didn\u2019t mean it that way. It was just the word I picked, a synonym for something else. I really like what Jim Coudal said about goals:\u201cThe reason that most of us are unhappy most of the time is that we set our goals not for the person we\u2019re going to be when we reach them, but we set our goals for the person we are when we set them.

    "title": "Understanding the Balance of Obvious, Easy, and Possible in Product Development",
    "content": "Much of the tension in product development and interface design comes from trying to balance the obvious, the easy, and the possible. Figuring out which things go in which bucket is critical to fully understanding how to make something useful. Shouldn\u2019t everything be obvious? Unless you\u2019re making a product that just does one thing \u2013 like a paperclip, for example \u2013 everything won\u2019t be obvious. You have to make tough calls about what needs to be obvious, what should be easy, and what should be possible. The more things something (a product, a feature, a screen, etc) does, the more calls you have to make. This isn\u2019t the same as prioritizing things. High, medium, low priority doesn\u2019t tell you enough about the problem. \u201cWhat needs to be obvious?\u201d is a better question to ask than \u201cWhat\u2019s high priority?\u201d Further, priority doesn\u2019t tell you anything about cost. And the first thing to internalize is that everything has a cost. Making something obvious has a cost. You can\u2019t make everything obvious because you have limited resources. I\u2019m not talking money\u2014although that may be part of it too. I\u2019m primarily talking screen real estate, attention span, comprehension, etc. Making something obvious is expensive because it often means you have to make a whole bunch of other things less obvious. Obvious dominates and only one thing can truly dominate at a time. It may be worth it to make that one thing completely obvious, but it\u2019s still expensive. Obvious is all about always. The thing(s) people do all the time, the always stuff, should be obvious. The core, the epicenter, the essence of the product should be obvious. Beyond obvious, you\u2019ll find easy. The things that should be easy are the things that people do frequently, but not always. It all depends on your product, and your customer, but when you build a product you should know the difference between the things people do all the time and the things they do often. This can be hard, and will often lead to the most internal debates, but it\u2019s important to think deeply about the difference between always and often so you get this right. And finally are the things that are possible. These are things people do sometimes. Rarely, even. So they don\u2019t need to be front and center, but they need to be possible. Possible is usually the trickiest category because the realistic list of things that should be possible will often be significantly longer than the list of things that should be obvious or easy. That means that some things on the possible list might be better off off the list completely. Instead of making them possible, maybe not making them at all is the right call. Coming to know the difference between obvious, easy, and possible takes a lot of practice, deep thinking, critical analysis, and, often, debate. It\u2019s a constant learning process. It helps you figure out what really matters. But once you\u2019re able to see the buckets clearly, and you begin to think about things in terms of obvious, easy, and possible instead of high, medium, and low priority, you\u2019re on your way to building better products.",

    "content": "Years ago I used to be a hothead. Whenever anyone said anything, I\u2019d think of a way to disagree. I\u2019d push back hard if something didn\u2019t fit my world-view. It\u2019s like I had to be first with an opinion \u2013 as if being first meant something. But what it really meant was that I wasn\u2019t thinking hard enough about the problem. The faster you react, the less you think. Not always, but often. It\u2019s easy to talk about knee jerk reactions as if they are things that only other people have. You have them too. If your neighbor isn\u2019t immune, neither are you. This came to a head back in 2007. I was speaking at the Business Innovation Factory conference in Providence, RI. So was Richard Saul Wurman. After my talk Richard came up to introduce himself and compliment my talk. That was very generous of him. He certainly didn\u2019t have to do that. And what did I do? I pushed back at him about the talk he gave. While he was making his points on stage, I was taking an inventory of the things I didn\u2019t agree with. And when presented with an opportunity to speak with him, I quickly pushed back at some of his ideas. I must have seemed like such an asshole. His response changed my life. It was a simple thing. He said \u201cMan, give it five minutes.\u201d I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it\u2019s fine to disagree, it\u2019s fine to push back, it\u2019s great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you\u2019re sure you want to argue against them. \u201cFive minutes\u201d represented \u201cthink\u201d, not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion looking to prove something, not learn something. This was a big moment for me. Richard has spent his career thinking about these problems. He\u2019s given it 30 years. And I gave it just a few minutes. Now, certainly he can be wrong and I could be right, but it\u2019s better to think deeply about something first before being so certain you\u2019re right. There\u2019s also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. Ask more questions. Learning to think first rather than react quick is a life long pursuit. It\u2019s tough. I still get hot sometimes when I shouldn\u2019t. But I\u2019m really enjoying all the benefits of getting better. If you aren\u2019t sure why this is important, think about this quote from Jonathan Ive regarding Steve Jobs\u2019 reverence for ideas: And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished. That\u2019s deep. Ideas are fragile. They often start powerless. They\u2019re barely there, so easy to ignore or skip or miss. There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people\u2019s money and 2. Dismissing an idea. Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn\u2019t involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That\u2019s easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea. So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it\u2019s too hard or it\u2019s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.",

    "title": "The Golden Path: Designing Software Defaults",
    "content": "One of my favorite things about designing software is designing the defaults. The defaults define the experience for everyone out of the box. And, therefore, for most people in perpetuity. Convention over configuration rules the day. To me, everything it could possibly do is less interesting than what it does right now, factory fresh. At 37signals we call this The Golden Path and we discuss it often. If a customer followed our lead, stayed in the grooves, and did exactly as the software suggested, what would that experience be like? That's the one nearly everyone will have, so making it great is our top priority. Certainly some will take the path least traveled. Others will head to whatever gear icon they can find and start turning the dials and pulling the levers. And then there are those who enjoy figuring out how to break things by imagining every exception or edge case, and seeing how the app handles it. It's great to have these customers too! But they aren't the ones that pay the bills. Most buy something they just want to work. Configuration is a drag, not a desire. Setting something up brings them down. They just want their struggle out of the way, and choosing and buying the thing was the majority of the work they signed up for. The rest should just glide. Defaults aren't just about nailing The Golden Path, it's also about choosing one. What experience do we want people to have? What opinions do we want to carve into the product? It's not just what we're trying to do, it's what we're trying to say. So if you really want to know what a company thinks about their product, their customer, and the experience they imagine is the best one, just roll with the stock product. Don't mess with it, use it as is. That's the best way to know what something's really like, what was intended, and experience a pure point of view.",

    "title": "Random Thoughts on the Origins of Life",
    "content": "Just listened to Lex Fridman and Sara Walker talk about the origins of life, the search for life, what is life, etc. It was a wonderfully refreshing, nourishing conversation. It made me want to spill out some random thoughts on the subject. I’m unqualified, but I’m curious. Our search for life off this planet is inherently primitive. We search for life based on our definitions, using instruments designed to detect what we already know. And who can blame us? It would be impossible to look for what we wouldn’t recognize in a way that we can’t realize. It wasn’t until the 17th century that we even discovered microbial life. And microbial life is the most plentiful life on earth, far surpassing the biomass of plant, animal, and fungal life combined. There’s more of it than anything, and we’ve always been living among it, yet we didn’t know it was here. But it wasn’t just that. Since we share a common ancestor with microbial life, we didn’t find new life, we found an earlier version of who we were. Imagine a microbe evolving so much intelligence that it forgot where it came from, only to invent instruments billions of years later to find itself again. That’s what happened. How beautiful is that? Maybe it will happen again. If we find life elsewhere, we might be discovering a more advanced version of ourselves. Or if life finds us, it might rediscover its primitive origins. If we can forget and lose our history once, why couldn't we forget and lose our future again? It makes me think about what other forms life could take. And how we might never be able to detect it. Let’s imagine that thoughts were a form of life. They feel like it. They mate, they multiply, they evolve, they consume us, they drive us, they make us move, they seem to be born, they seem to die. They seem to have their own agency, appearing in your mind whether welcome or not. But you can't see thoughts. You don't even know a thought exists until you, or someone else, has it. Maybe thoughts are location-based, waiting in every place. To discover one, you can’t look for it. Rather, you have to be where it is. Imagine what it would be like to stand on Mars, looking back at Earth. But if you were actually there, you’d almost certainly have a thought you couldn’t have here. Insights incompatible with any earthly experience. Questions that couldn’t be contemplated without standing on Martian sand. From Mars, the Earth is mirror. From Earth, Mars is a mirror. Both mirrors, but each perspective reflecting entirely different thoughts. You can’t see the same view or have the same thought from the other place. You must be there to meet thoughts living there. Maybe thoughts don't exist in time and space but in mind and place. This specific mind, in that specific place. Then imagine trying to look for thoughts with our instruments and techniques. Nothing would register. Trillions of thoughts unnoticed, unaware. They can’t be measured, they can only be experienced. How could we ever find them without having them, without being there, without being them? We search for life as if it's something to be found. But perhaps there's something even more alive, beyond our current understanding.",

A tight grip denies certain degrees of freedom, limits subtlety, and ups the fatigue factor. Plus you give up the gift of bounce the drum heads happily offer. It’s like you’re constantly paying interest vs. borrowing for free. I had the same experience when learning to play guitar. It’s like I was trying to choke the neck to death. Clenching the neck makes every change a three step process: Release, move, and clamp down again. It’s slower, it’s harder, and it’s a lot less natural than a flowing motion up and down the neck, pausing to play, rather than stopping. It’s a curious thing. We tend to hold on too tightly early on. It seems to be part of learning just about anything. It's in the nature of starting. When you don’t know what you’re doing, at least you know how to squeeze. But then, you discover that making progress requires you to release a little, to lighten up on your grip. A big part of what you see when you watch someone great is what you don’t see.

    "title": "Developing the Ability to Tease Things Apart",
    "content": "In my experience, a key skill to develop is the ability to separate one thing from another. To prevent the small from becoming the all. Take a policy, for example. Could be a government, or a school, or a home owner’s association, or something at work. Whatever it is, you don’t like it. You don’t agree, you don’t like the decision maker, you don’t like how it was enacted, pick a reason, it doesn’t matter which. When you don’t like something, there’s a tendency for that one thing to become everything. Now you don’t like the whole government, Or the whole school. Or the whole association. Or the whole company. Or, if it’s a specific problem with a product, then the whole product is a problem. Is it? Or is it you? Not you as in you did the thing, but you dissolving the membranes, turning a complex organism back into a single cell. It’s psychologically simpler to cast an opinion collectively than it is specifically, but in the end, that easy street often leads to a dead end. It’s easy to feel “I’m pissed”, but really, just part of you is pissed. At that same time, another part of you loves your partner, another part of you is excited about the trip you’re about to take, another part of you is nervous awaiting the results of a recent blood draw, another part of you is focused on the current task, another part is hungry for lunch. We contain multitudes, and recognizing that you’re a thousand things rather than your most obvious emotion is a step towards maturity. Take something your friend said recently. You kinda can’t believe they said it. Shocked, even. They’re on that side? They took that take? Ok, let’s say they did. Now, do you let it bleed into everything else you think about them? You could, but I’d suggest that’s your problem, not theirs. What about the other things about them? They’re your friend, after all. You got here somehow, and it wasn’t because of the things you didn’t like about them. There’s a good chance all the good stuff is still the good stuff. The relationship has more depth now. In this context, complexity is a gift. Now replace friend with government or group or company or product or organization. Developing the ability to tease things apart helps you compartmentalize the less desirable from the more desirable, and see the whole map, with all its separate states of like and dislike, favorable and unfavorable. There’s a very good chance that when you do that, you’ll like a lot more than you despise. Kids know this, then it seems they — we — forget it. Kids like their food separated. Don’t let the blueberries touch — CONTAMINATE! — the chips. Don’t let the carrots graze the sandwich. Don’t let the cookies touch the cheese. This way they can HATE the carrots, but love their lunch. In an absurd way, it seems like the healthy approach. Separate. Distinguish. Decouple. Isolate. Differentiate. One thing’s rarely everything, unless you make it so. -Jason -Jason",

    "title": "Why I'm Still Doing This",
    "content": "I’ve been doing this for 25 years, so I’ll often be asked why I’m still in it and how I stay motivated. It ain’t the money, as I’ve been fortunate enough to make more than I’ll ever be able to spend. I enjoy the work and we have a great crew, each a true pleasure to work with. I remain filled with ideas. So that’s part of it. But it’s more that than. It’s more of a justice thing, really. Look at this screenshot. This is software my neighborhood uses to manage guest parking passes. It’s shit. Maybe you recognize it, maybe you don’t, but the name doesn’t matter. You know what the company charges for the privilege of using it? $10,000/year. $10,000 A YEAR! $10,000 year after year of our HOA budget goes to this crap. It feels borderline criminal. I’m still doing this because the world is flooded with overpriced, crappy, subpar software. It hurts people and it hurts the economy. I feel a moral obligation to do what I can to replace bad options with great options, at vastly reduced prices. I even want to replace great options with equally great options, just at reduced prices. Good software should not be expensive. Software is an absolute miracle. You can make exceptionally good stuff at exceptionally reasonable prices. It’s not like hardware manufacturing where you have to cut all sorts of corners to keep costs in check, or charge a ton for stuff that’s truly well made. Raw materials, machinery, manufacturing, tight tolerances, physics — this stuff costs a lot to get right. Software does not. Yet bad — and great software, frankly — remains way over priced. And some is absolute highway robbery. Like this parking pass software. It’s clear no one cared about it — it’s just built to some spec by people who will never use it. It’s all there, the features tick the boxes, and technically it works, but we’d never ever find it acceptable if it was a physical product. But since it’s software, it can suck and we can still be sold on a $10,000/year contract. This fuels me. So hell yeah I’m motivated. And the more bad stuff I bump into, or even great stuff with silly numbers attached, the more motivated I get. It’s a deep well that keeps on providing. To that end, we’ve just started working on two more new products this year. We’re on a tear. We’re going to keep on putting quality stuff out there at reasonable prices. Not just to prove that it can be done, but because it must be done. -Jason About Jason Fried Hey! I'm Jason, the Co-Founder and CEO at 37signals, makers of Basecamp and HEY.

Long time frames give you invisible space to pack away unrealistic amounts of work. Since later is so far away, there’s no harm in kicking the can down the line. In other words, later makes a pile at the end. Gnarly problem you can’t figure out how to solve yet? Punt it into the later pile. Design not coming together quite right? Toss it in the later pile. Taking on lots of technical debt as you go? Push it into the later pile.

Towels on bars require effort to display well. Hooks can hold anything with a loop or a bend or a catch — loofas, shower caps, hats, rain soaked jackets and backpacks, etc. Towel bars can’t hold nearly as much, even though they take up much more space. Hooks can hold multiple towels at once, with enough air getting to multiple layers because of the uneven ridges that single point hanging creates. Towel bars layer wet towels, leaving ones at the bottom or middle struggling to dry. You can’t mount a hook crookedly. You can absolutely mount a towel bar unevenly. Reasons go on. But what do towel hooks have to do with product development? For me, just about everything. They’re a frame, they’re a lens, they’re aspirational.

    "content": "Have you ever been asked \"What do you wish you knew then that you know now?\" I have. And I hate the question. It's usually framed in a way that encourages you to pretend to place yourself in the nascent days of your career, or early adulthood. Back when you didn't know much, when you were trying to figure things out. Essentially it's asking you which mistakes you wish you didn't make. To squint and identify the things you could have bypassed if you were armed with the wisdom of hindsight. My take? I think you’d have made the same mistakes, and I don’t think you could have avoided anything that happened. Why? First, it assumes you'd even listen to your 50 year old self when you were 20. Next it assumes you'd even be ready and able to accept the advice you didn't recognize as relevant. Last it assumes you'd be able to avoid the things you didn't see coming. I don't think you could, would, or should. Learning is experiencing and doing. It’s not dodging, following, or forgoing. You had to go through the shit to learn the shit. Sidestepping it would have just landed you in some other shit. And then you'd have wished you had listened to different advice. You wouldn’t have your sage advice today if you hadn’t had the stupid experiences then! In fact, answering the question would erase present you from existence. Because if you were different then, you wouldn’t be the you you know now. Are there mistakes I wish I hadn’t made? One one hand, absolutely — plenty — but on the other hand, I had to make them to be who I am now. There’s no version of me that’s present me today with a different set of events in the past. I like who I am now, even with portions of my past I’m less satisfied with peering through present day goggles. But it’s a fantasy to think that if I’d just had magical advice from some old dude named me, then I wouldn’t have made those mistakes back then. Cut yourself some slack. -Jason",

But where did the questions come from? Best practices? Opinions on what to ask and how to ask it? According to who? Are you sure those words before the question marks were the right ones? What if the questions were asked differently? So much certainty coming out, so little going in. \"How often do you...\" vs \"How often would you...\" vs. \"Last week did you?\". The responses to those could be wildly different. Did you check your words as closely as you checked your results? If you slide back a few steps, you'll see that it's all a judgement call. How you asked, what you asked, when you asked, which words you paired together, how you started the question... All these things matter. In fact, they are the matter that form the answer. And you know what? There's no right way. Which is the exactly the point I'm trying to make. Your hard data comes from subjectivity. A sense of solidity built from mush.

    "title": "Finding Balance in Product Development",
    "content": "One of my greatest pleasures at work is trying to find that point where everything feels just right. Nothing more, nothing less, but right there in the pocket. It's almost fractal. It's there in every component, in every feature, in every flow, in every sequence, in every product, in every decision, inside everything across the company. How do you know when it's just right? It's the same feeling you get when you try to balance something physical. You know it. You put something on something else and try to find that center of gravity... A bit to the right, oops too much. Lean back to the left... Steady... Steady... Ugh, too much push. Stack it up again, find that center... Wobble, bobble, almost... And then it locks in. Da! There it is. All the sudden the pushing and pulling forces disappear and it's just there, on its own. Still, in harmony and equanimity. That's what just right feels like. It's easy to experience physically because our bodies speak the language. We feel the weight, we intuit the momentum. Our internal gyroscopes sense balance, and transfers it into objects we touch. But when it comes to intellectual, conceptual things like business or software, we have to shift into the imagined sense of balance. We don't get the free borders, edges, weights, shapes, and gravity, to help us find that middle. Muscles don't pull on tendons don't pull on bones. Our nerves don't get the signals for free. So I imagine. If this was physical, would it balance? I literally think about the center of gravity of an idea, a feature, a button, an idea, a product. Is there too much weight over here? Too much over there? If this whole thing was in stone, would it crash to one side? Or would it stand a chance of staying upright? Would it be at rest, or would it want to fall? Once you find that spot — the right set of features, the right flows, the right yesses and the right no's, you stop. That's v1. Once you find the balance, you aim to stay in balance. Adding more, but in a balanced way to maintain the form, to keep the center. To hold steady. It's a beautiful thing. That's how I think about making products. -Jason",

    "content": "20 years ago today I'd never really launched a product before, so posting to our blog was only way I knew how to do it. And social media hadn't even been invented yet, so where else was I supposed to put it? In fact, guess what else happened to launch the same day as Basecamp? Facebook. So we're talking the stone age. I was announcing this new thing we built called We figured if we needed it, plenty of others probably did too. And it turns out they did! We were right. Not only was Basecamp something entirely new at the time, the distribution model, and business model, were new too. We weren't the first to offer software as a subscription service, but we were very, very early. So early in fact that the bank wouldn't allow us to accept annual payments on credit cards because they didn't want to be on the hook if this new software as a subscription service model thing didn't work out in a few months. That's why we could only initially bill monthly! Which turned out to be a pretty good thing in the end. You never know what's going to happen until after it happens. And happen it did. We had this idea that, I don't know, if we could maybe make $5,000 a month after the first year, we'd be on to something. That would be a nice $60,000/year business, which we'd feather into our web design business. We'd essentially treat it as a perpetual client — we being our own client. Turns out that we hit that $5000/month mark in a few weeks. And a year or so later, Basecamp was generating more revenue for us than our web design business. So we shut that part of the business down and went all-in on Basecamp. And software in general. So much came from Basecamp. And so much still does. Rails came from Basecamp. And tens of thousands of programming careers came from Rails. Other businesses sprang up. Software as a service was further legitimized. And the cycle that began back in the early 2000s continues to spin strongly today. It's been the professional honor of a lifetime to be able to build something that matters to so many, and to build that thing alongside so many extraordinary people, for so many extraordinary people. From co-workers to customers to fellow business owners, and everyone I've met along the way, what an incredible ride it's been so far. And today's Basecamp is the best it's ever been, by far. It's a thrill to watch whole new generation of entrepreneurs, product teams, and small businesses are discovering the secret so many have known: As 2024 marks 20 years of Basecamp, it also marks 25 years of When you've been around an industry long enough, you get to see how cyclical everything is. The Earth is round, and so are trends. When you're close to something, it looks like it's on a straight line forever, but when you step back, and wait awhile, you'll often see it crest the curve, bend out of view, and eventually sneak back up on you from behind. Oh, that again! I remember that. Yeah, that was good. One of the real treats of a long career is to revisit the past and pull some of those better ideas ahead into the present. Right now it feels like we've got a bag of bright ideas slung over our shoulder. And we're headed out for new horizons. I feel so fortunate, and so grateful. Thank you.",

There’s only one rule: You can’t turn around, there’s no going back. Where would you start? Given the dimensions of the pool, here’s how I’d do it: I’d start near the edge. The edge effectively creates multiple “shores”. You can swim all the way to the end, or you can grab the side and stop for a breath, a break, or even decide “that’s enough” and stop there. This is optionality. More points of survival. To me this represents independence. But not everyone decides to start at the edge. Oftentimes, a key strategic decision pushes them center: Raising money. And the more money they raise, the further center they’re pushed. At some point, there’s only one way to make the business work: To reach the other side. Once you begin, the edges are further away than the end. There’s no optionality, you can’t stop. You either make it across, or you die. The choice between VC funding and bootstrapping independently depends on an entrepreneur's appetite for risk and personal definition of success.

Designs in files that were delivered, but never really deployed. There was nothing there in the end. You didn't get to make any bets, you just played with someone else's chips. You thought you were changing things. Changing them. But it wasn't change, it was an exchange. You handed it over, they handed you something in return, and that was that. I'm glad I went through it, otherwise I wouldn't have known it. Been giving other people advice for years? Give yourself the advice and see if it's any good. Meet the market. Go make something. Join a team that's making something. Put your fingerprint on something that won't just sit on the shelf somewhere. I have to say, I've found no greater professional joy than working with a tight group of people to ship and support our own products. And for those products to find people willing to trade their own hard earned treasure for a little bit of ours.Betting on an idea — and seeing it through — is enormously fulfilling. The creative and intellectual stimulation is beyond compare. Especially when you're the first customer for anything you make. When I was a consultant doing work for hire I thought it was the peak.

    "title": "Analog vs Digital: A Comparison",
    "content": "I’m going to draw a parallel that isn’t quite straight, but it’s close enough. It’s between old (analog) cars and new (digital) cars, simple (analog) businesses and complicated (digital) businesses. Lately I’ve been driving two distinctly different cars. One from 1970, and the other from 2023. They essentially have nothing in common other than that you sit in them, they have four tires that contact the road, and you control them with a steering wheel and pedals. Some who don’t care much for cars might say that’s everything in common. On paper I can see the argument, but get behind the wheel of both, and go for a drive, and you wouldn’t say the experiences were equivalent. They’re as different as different can be. The 1970s experience is analog. Your leg strength determines your stopping power. The road surface below clearly communicates with your ass. The steering wheel actually feels like it’s turning the wheels. The windows roll down by turning a crank that literally rolls them down. Switches snick, dials click. This is a direct experience, with mechanical feedback, requiring full attention and real effort. The 2023 experience is digital. Nearly everything is abstracted. The brakes are heavily mechanically assisted. Steering even more so. You can’t really feel the road surface because the suspension masterfully absorbs every little detail. Even the buttons have been replaced by touchscreens with haptics. This is an indirect experience, with simulated feedback, requiring some attention and little effort. Which you prefer is up to you. I happen to love both for different reasons. And that’s just driving. The gulf is wider when it comes to repair. With an old analog car, a problem’s cause is more obvious. Linkages are visible, this connects to that, teeth mesh to move gears which move shafts which move wheels. When something’s broken it’s generally confirmable with a common tool and a set of eyeballs. Any mechanic with a basic understanding can diagnose any problem relatively easily — sometime solely by ear. There are only so many things it could be, and they’re all right in front of you. With a modern new car, computers enter the picture. Engines are covered, sometimes even inaccessible. Cars crash, but so does firmware. This doesn’t turn that, this sends electrons to that, which are then interpreted by circuits and software and systems. Which one’s to blame when something doesn’t work? It’ll take a while to find out, and at least $1000. Almost anything can be wrong, and you’ll have to leave the car at the shop for a while so they can plug it in and run diagnostics. The human defers to the machine to tell us. Pros and cons for sure. Now for the parallels to business. Through this car experience lens, I’ve come to see businesses as either analog or digital too. I’m not describing their product or what they make. I’m talking about how they’re structured, how they run. An analog business can make software, and a digital business can make pizza. An analog business is direct. It’s clear what does what, and how it does it. When something changes, you typically know what changed. There’s some suspension to absorb the bumps, but it’s basic — you’re never too far removed from the root cause. There are fewer managers and more doers. There’s less distance between the customer and the maker. Feedback is heard, not interpreted and translated. No decks, just conversations and writing. A digital business is indirect and abstracted. The structure is obscured, riddled with departments and groups run by other groups. Decisions are complicated because one too many people are involved. What should be simple has become complex — the result of process that serves the prospect, not the purpose. Everything is padded. Getting to someone requires going through something. Customers are a concept, sliced by demographics. Everything’s a presentation rather than a conversation. As usual, the analogies and metaphors don’t map perfectly, but hopefully you feel what I’m getting at. Does it resonate? I aim to run an analog business. Direct, clear, obvious, fair, and easy to fix. -Jason",

    "content": "In the course of building products, you'll likely experience moments when you're unsure of a certain screen, flow, condition, label, idea, whatever. Maybe this button doesn't feel right. Or the name of this feature feels unresolved. Or some color is jarring, but kind of interesting nonetheless. Or the way something gets set up seems a bit kludgy at the moment. Maybe this stuff is alright, maybe it's not, but it feels unsettled. I like these moments. It's practice. It's a chance to sit with them, to let them be, to work on other things while they marinate in the back of your mind. They aren't blockers, they aren't deal breakers — they're just things that may or may not work out. Sometimes time makes them work. Or reveals that they certainly don't. Sometimes they weren't that important anyway, and it's just a matter of getting used to them. Sometimes they're novel and unusual — which can be jarring to the uninitiated — but endearing to the experienced. Sometimes! So just let them be. Come back around to them later if they continue to bug you. It's perfectly OK to leave things unresolved, and let the resolution force itself on you eventually. If you forget about them, they didn't matter anyway. If you can't forget, maybe they do matter more than you realized. Projects unfold. Live with them for a while. The answers will reveal themselves when they're ready. Maybe this button doesn't feel right. Or the name of this feature feels unresolved.

    "title": "Commoditization and Software Services",
    "content": "Once a product category proves popular, it's common for more companies to enter the market. Eventually, many options appear that are essentially mostly the same. Now we've got something that quacks like a commodity. Once we've got a commodity, generics eventually follow. Devoid of fancy packaging, marketing, and advertising, prices fall while quality remains perfectly acceptable. Brand name products might be slightly better on some dimensions, but it ultimately becomes a value judgement. A few bucks difference? The confidence of buying a brand name still feels worth it. Many, many bucks different? Maybe not. This happens in most industries. Maybe not in airplanes, but absolutely in peanut butter. And you know what's closer to peanut butter than airplanes? Software is. Strangely, many software categories have commoditized, but, given that nearly everything is a service these days, operational costs have remained universally high. This makes it hard for lower priced generics to creep in. This means people continue to pay luxury prices for software services that are essentially commodities. We think something's wrong with that. Sounds like an opportunity. This is where ONCE comes in. One facet of our initial strategy with ONCE is to find those commoditized pay-forever services everyone's running, and make our own radically simplified '80/20' versions as pay-once products. And this time you get to own for less, not rent for more. And you'll get the code, too. In about a month we'll unveil the first ONCE product. Any guesses?",
