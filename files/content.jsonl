That's what two decades worth of entrenched habits will do to your belief in change! But not only was it possible, it's been immensely enjoyable. What seemed so difficult at first now appears trivial, since it's been done. That's not a critique of the Apple ecosystem per se. Apple continues to make great hardware and pretty good software too. And I think accepting that fact from the get go actually makes sticking to a switch more likely to succeed. Falling in love with something new is a better and healthier motivator than hating something old. That's been my experience with Linux in particular. I've come to love the setup I've enshrined in the Omakub project. It does a whole host of things much nicer than the old macOS walled garden experience, on top of the fact that running an open source operating system simply feels right for someone who owes their entire career to open source. It's a positive vision: I really, really like what Linux has to offer these days. It's a similar feeling, albeit not as strong, with the switch to Android. I don't have any illusions that Google is any gentler of a corporate giant than Apple. The two have very similar ideas about extracting monopoly rents from their respective app stores. But the slogan that Android is more open is actually true. Now plenty of people don't really care about that openness, and that's fine. But I do. I care about being able to download the Fortnite APK straight from Epic Games, and being able to play our favorite family game with the kids, without having to ask someone for permission. Sure, it could be a bit more convenient if the game was available in the Play Store, but spending another two minutes doing the direct install is nothing against the hundreds of hours we've spent playing since. The same is true in terms of customization. I'm running this beautiful, minimal launcher called olauncher, which turns Android into a far less addictive mobile experience by replacing icons and app drawers with a simple set of text links. It's great. And it's the kind of stuff you can only really do properly on Android, because replacing the default launcher is possible. Getting out of the Apple rut has also lead me to discover an amazing new world of both software and hardware. Solutions that I just wasn't in the market for after settling into an Apple grove over the years. Since switching to Linux, I've picked up Neovim as my new editor of choice, I've fallen in love with the Framework 13 laptop, and recently, I've even gotten into mechanical keyboards (the current choice being the NuPhy Air75). That's what a change of scenery can do for you. Force you to open your eyes to what else is out there. And in turn introduce you to new ways of doing and being. That's a gift in and of itself. Now I'm not telling you any of this to convince you to give up your Mac or your iPhone. People who love their Apple gear aren't going to be convinced by an alternative positive vision because they're simply not in the market for one. That's where I was for a long time. Just not interested. I'm telling you this in case your Apple relationship isn't quite so hunky dory. In case their recent trajectory and relationship with developers might have been bugging you too. Because it's in that situation you really need to know that the alternatives are not just present, they're good. Their value isn't defined as not-Apple. There's no valor in that. Linux is wonderful, is flawed, is messy, is beautiful, is nerdy, is different. Android is customizable, is open, is fragmented, is less polished, is experimental. All the pros and the cons are true at the same time. And it's a compelling adventure to discover whether the trade-offs speak to you. Don't be afraid to take the trip, but give it at least two weeks (if not two months!), and don't think of the journey as a way to find the same home in a different place. Be open to a new home, in a new way, in a new place. You might just like it.", "date": "2024-07-12T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

And company chat with Campfire in 2005. And, fast forward, now with #nobuild, Hotwire, and even exiting the cloud. When I discover a path that seems like a clear shortcut, it doesn't really matter if it's poorly paved at first. As long as it appears to take us somewhere better, laying the bricks and clearing the brush is incidental. It's about seeing that end state. Where what's right in front of us now, rough and unpolished as it may be, can be transformed, if we put in the effort, that inspires me to keep going. Yes, half the fun is the adventure. We should always be pushing toward new horizons, even if some of them inevitably will end up in dead ends. But the other half is watching things genuinely compound for the better. Take web development. It's incredible how much conceptual complexity we've been able to compress in the last decade, and particularly in the last half of a decade. It wasn't just one thing, it was all the things. It was browsers getting better, mobile CPUs getting faster, #nobuild becoming possible, Hotwire showing an alternate route. Each substantial, yes, but together epoch altering. A new dawn. Following such a sense of wanderlust requires a certain disagreeableness. Even arrogance. A steadfast belief that it's possible that you might actually have found a better way. Whether that turns out to be true or not. You have to believe that it's possible. That the market place of ideas isn't perfectly efficient or perfectly rational. That it hasn't priced it all in, and that you could invest in upcoming concepts for an intellectual profit. You're never going to be right about everything, but a life spent without taking at least a few bets on being early on an idea is one not lived to the fullest. Dare a little.

It's almost like there's a rite of passage in certain parts of the community where becoming an expert in the intricacies of every tool and its theming is required to prove you're a proper nerd. I think that's a bit silly, so I created [Omakub: An opinionated web developer setup for Ubuntu](https://omakub.org).Omakub turns a fresh Ubuntu installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command. No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omakub is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best. Omakub includes a curated set of applications and tools that one might discover through hours of watching YouTube, reading blogs, or just stumbling around Linux internet. All so someone coming straight from a platform like Windows or the Mac can immediately start enjoying a ready-made system, without having to do any configuration and curation legwork at all. This isn’t a project for someone already versed in the intricacies of nixOS or relishing a fresh install of Arch. It’s using vanilla Ubuntu because that’s one of the most widely adopted Linux distributions, and one that is even a pre-install option from many computer vendors. But while Ubuntu has a great package manager in apt, many of the tools that developers want either haven’t been packaged, need more recent versions than what has been frozen in the LTS, or need actions post-install necessary for the best operation. Omakub includes all those scripts needed. But package management is only half the battle of getting a great development experience going on Linux. The other half lies in the dotfiles that control the configuration. Linux gets great power from how customizable it is, but that also presents a paradox of choice and a tall learning curve. Having good, curated defaults that integrate all the many tools in a coherent feel and look can help more developers acquire a taste for Linux, which they may then later inspire a fully bespoke setup (or not!). Nothing in Omakub provides solutions to problems you couldn’t also solve a million other ways. The main benefit is in The Omakase Spirit. The idea that an entire setup experience can benefit from being tailored upfront by someone with strong opinions about what works and looks good together. This doesn’t make the choices necessarily better than other choices. Linux has inspired a million options for a million tastes. That’s great and worthy of celebration. But there’s a large constituency of developers who are more than willing to trade ultimate bespoke customization for a cohesive package of goods, at least until they understand what all the options are and have fully bought into making the switch to Linux.

So I pursued the path of the crusade, attempting to convert the unenlightened masses by the edge of a pointed argument.And for a long time, I thought that's what had worked. That this was why Ruby on Rails took off, became one of the most popular full-stack web frameworks of all time, inspired countless clones, and created hundreds of billions in enterprise value for companies built on it. But I was wrong. It wasn't the crusade that did it. Since those early days, I've talked to thousands of programmers who adopted Ruby on Rails back then, and do you know what virtually every one of them cite? That original 15-minute blog video. Which didn't contain a single comparison to other named solutions or specifically pointed arguments against alternatives. It just showed what you could do with Ruby on Rails, and the A/B comparison automatically ran inside the mind of every programmer who was exposed to that.That's what did it. Showing something great, and letting those who weren't happy with their current situation become inspired to check it out. Because those are the only people who are able to convert to your cause anyway. I've never seen someone who was head'over'heels in love with, say, functional programming be won over by arguments for objected-oriented programming. You simply can't dunk someone into submission, and it's usually counterproductive if you try. But you can absolutely attract people who aren't happy with their current circumstances to give an alternative a chance, if you simply show them how it works, and allow them to conclude by themselves how it would make their programming life better. What I've also come to realize is that programmers come in many different intellectual shapes and sizes. Some of those shapes will click with functional programming, and that'll be their path to passion. Others will click with vanilla JavaScript, and be relieved to give up the build pipelines. Others still will find their spirit in Go. This is great. Seriously. The fact that working for the web allows for such diverse ecosystem choices is an incredible feature, not a bug. I found my life's work and passion in Ruby. I have friends who've found theirs in Python or Elixir or PHP or Go or even JavaScript. That's wonderful! And that's really all I want for you. I want you to be happy. I want you to find just that right language that opens your mind to the beautiful game of coding in your most compatible mode of conception, as Ruby did for me. This is not the same as just saying everything has trade-offs, use what works best. That to me is a bit of a cop out. There is no universal set of trade-offs that'll make something objectively work best. Half the programming conundrum lies in connecting to an enduring source of motivation. I wouldn't be a happy camper if I had to spend my days programming Rust (but I LOVE so many of the tools coming out of that community by people who DO enjoy just that). It also doesn't mean we should give up on technical discussions of advantages or disadvantages, but I think those are generally more effective when performed in the style of here's what I like, why I like it, so look at my code, my outcomes, and see if it tickles your fancy too. Programming is a beautiful game. I would give up all the fancy cars I have in a heartbeat, if I was made to choose between them and programming. The intellectual stimulation, the occasional high from hitting The Zone, is such a concrete illustration of Coco Chanel's the best things in life are free, the second best things are very expensive. Programming is one of those best things that is virtually free to everyone in the Western world (and increasingly so everywhere else too). So let's play that beautiful game to the best of our ability, in the position that flatters our conceptual capacities the most, and create some wonderful code.", "date": "2024-06-02T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

For designers, programmers, support, and everyone else. That mono culture had some clear advantages, like being able to run Kandji and macOS-specific setup scripts. But it certainly also had its disadvantages, like dealing with Apple's awful reliability years, and being cut off from seeing how half our Basecamp customer base saw by default (since they're on Windows!). Either way, it's over. Apple is no longer the exclusive default at 37signals. Going forward, we're working to make Linux the default for developers and system operators (and welcoming Windows back in the mix for accounting/marketing). I've personally been having a blast over the last few months digging deeper and deeper into the Linux rabbit hole, and it's been a delight discovering just how good its become as developer platform. Not one without its flaws, obviously, but an incredible proposition none the less. This has left me with little interest in going back to a commercial operating system as a daily development driver. My entire career has been spent in the service and sun of open source, both as a contributor and a beneficiary, and closing the loop with a desktop operating system is very satisfying. Default doesn't mean edict, though. First of all, we have a great mobile team that simply needs to be on Apple hardware to develop for Apple platforms. That's not changing. Neither is the fact that some people will have a strong personal preference to stick with the Mac. Totally fine too. But defaults still matter. Along with assumptions about what's supported and how well. And changing our default to Linux sets a new tone, as well as affords us the institutional weight to support companies like Framework with our business. I love voting with my dollars for more of a future I'd like to see, and Framework represents just that. The end result will be a company that has people running Mac, Windows, and Linux. Which is great from both the perspective of living how your customers do, but also escaping the trapped feeling of a mono culture built around an Apple that we, and many other developers, are increasingly at odds with. None of this has to be binary. Hate/love. Yes/no. Sure, Apple has evolved into a company that's much harder to recommend for people who care about the future of computing, but they still make great hardware, and the M-chip revolution will continue to benefit anyone who likes computers. So I haven't crushed my MacBook in defiance. We won't be wholesaling out our existing fleet of Apple machines either.

A thin sheen of flashy marketing design covering up for a rotten or deficient product. Something that looks good from afar, but reveals itself to be a disappointing imitation up close. They're right to be skeptical. Cheap veneers are the worst. But discarding the value of aesthetic on behalf of cheap imitations is a mistake. Not just because truly beautiful objects and concepts inevitably reveal a deeper and designed experience. That's the whole 'I'm writing you a long letter because I didn't have time to write you a short one'. Making something beautiful takes extra steps. Steps that are commonly also associated with extra care the rest of the creation. No, the primary reason I appreciate aesthetics so much is its power to motivate. And motivation is the rare fuel that powers all the big leaps I've ever taken in my career and with my projects and products. It's not time, it's even attention. It's motivation. And I've found that nothing quite motivates me like using and creating beautiful things. I don't think that would come as any surprise to people of the past. The history of creation is in part a tale of pursuing beautiful outcomes and rewards. But in our age, we've managed to deconstruct and problematize so much of what is self-evidently beautiful that it's harder to take the chase for granted. It's in the context of this age that I labor for programmers to rediscover beauty. Beautiful code, beautiful patterns, beautiful tools. Not to create a single, monoculture of aesthetics. That's never going to happen. But to elevate the work of making things look not just good, but sublime. To revel in it, to celebrate it. And beauty isn't binary. It's the journey of a thousand little decisions and investments in making something marginally prettier than it was before.

In theory, system tests, which drive a headless browser through your actual interface, offer greater confidence that the entire machine is working as it ought. And because it runs in a black-box fashion, it should be more resilient to implementation changes. But I'm sad to report that I have not found any of this to be true in practice. System tests remain as slow, brittle, and full of false negatives as they did a decade ago.I'm sure there are many reasons for this state of malaise. Browsers are complicated, UI driven by JavaScript is prone to timing issues, and figuring out WHY a black-box test has failed is often surprisingly difficult. But the bottom line for me is that system tests no longer seem worth the effort the majority of the time. Or said another way, I've wasted far more time getting system tests to work reliably than I have seen dividends from bugs caught. Which gets to the heart of why we automate testing. We do it for the quick feedback loop on changes, we do it to catch regressions, but most of all, we do it to become confident that the system works. These are all valid goals, but that doesn't mean system testing is the best way to fulfill them. Now I'm not advocating you throw out all your system tests. Just, you know, probably most of them. System tests work well for the top-level smoke test. The end-to-end'ness has a tendency to catch not problems with the domain model or business logic, but some configuration or interaction that's preventing the system from loading correctly at all. Catching that early and cheaply is good. The stickiest point, however, is not testing business logic, which model and controller tests do better and cheaper, but testing UI logic. Which means testing JavaScript. And I'll say I'm not sure we're there yet on the automated front. The method that gives me the most confidence that my UI logic is good to go is not system tests, but human tests. Literally clicking around in a real browser by hand. Because half the time UI testing is not just about 'does it work' but also 'does it feel right'. No automation can tell you that. HEY today has some 300-odd system tests.

Companies seem less excited about the prospects than they are petrified that its going to kill them. Maybe that fear is justified, maybe it's not, but what's incontestable is the kind of desperation it's leading to. Case in point: Slack. So Salesforce just announced that they'll be training their Slack AI models on people's private messages, files, and other content. And they're going to do so by default, lest you send them a specially formatted email to feedback@slack.com. I mean, really, feedback? It's the kind of process that invites a quip about some knuckle-sandwich feedback to their face. But I digress. Presumably this is because some Salesforce executives got the great idea in a brainstorming sesh that the way to catch up to the big players in AI is by just ignoring privacy concerns all together. If you can't beat the likes of OpenAI in scanning the sum of public human knowledge, maybe you can beat them by scanning all the confidential conversations about new product strategies, lay-off plans that haven't been announced yet, or private financial projections for 2025? I mean imagine the delight some CEO might feel when they start typing out the announcement to lay off 30% of the workforce, and Slack autocompletes the text with the most anodyne distillation from five competitors doing the same? All you have to do is edit out, say, Asana in your layoff completion, and voila, you'll have saved at least 8 minutes typing out the corporate slop yourself. Whether the vision of that gleams bright or dystopian probably depends on how well your inner compass is tuned to the kind of AI KPIs pushing product managers in charge of acquired chat products at large tech companies. But the more interesting point to me is what this says about the broad paranoia and desperation in the AI gold rush. Things are moving fast enough that we'll probably see more such flagrant transgressions of trust and privacy, if there's even a sliver of a chance that it can provide an edge in the race for a better chatbot.

The gift you've received is the software itself and the freedom of use granted by the license. That's it, and this ought to be straight forward, but I repeatedly see that it is not (no matter how often it is repeated). And I think the problem stems from the word \"community\", which implies a democratic decision-making process that never actually existed in the open source world.First of all, community implies that we're all participating on some degree of equal footing in the work required to further the welfare of the group. But that's not how the majority of open source projects are run. They're usually run by a small group of core contributors who take on the responsibility to advance the project, review patches, and guard the integrity of the vision. The division of labor isn't even close to be egalitarian. It's almost always distinctly elitist. That's good! Yes, elitism is good, when it comes to open source. You absolutely want projects to be driven by the people who show up to do the work, demonstrate their superior dedication and competence, and are thus responsible for keeping the gift factory churning out new updates, features, and releases. Productive effort is the correct moral basis of power in these projects. But this elitism is also the root of entitlement tension. What makes you think you're better than Me/Us/The Community in setting the direction for this project?? Wouldn't it be more *fair*, if we ran this on democratic consensus?? And it's hard to answer these question in a polite way that doesn't aggravate the tension or offend liberal sensibilities (in the broad historic sense of that word -- not present political alignments).So we usually skirt around the truth. That not all participants in an open source project contribute equally in neither volume nor value, and this discrepancy is the basis of the hierarchical nature of most projects. It is not, and never will be, one user, one vote. That is, it will never be democratic. And this is good! The democratic ideals are fulfilled by the fact that open source is free and full of alternatives. Don't like how they're running a given project? Use one of the usual countless alternatives. Or start your own! Here, you can even use the work of a million projects that came before you as a base for doing new work. But the reason this doesn't resolve the tension is that it still relies on showing up and doing the work. And there just so happens to be far fewer individuals willing and capable of doing that than there are individuals who wish they had a say on the direction of their favorite software. You can't solve that tension, only acknowledge it. I've dealt with it for literally twenty years with my work on Rails and a million other open source projects. There's an ever-latent instinct in a substantial subset of open source users who will continuously rear itself to question why it's the people who do the most work or deliver the most value or start the most projects that get to have the largest say. And when people talk about open source burnout, it's often related to this entitlement syndrome. Although it's frequently misdiagnosed as a problem of compensation. As if begging for a few dollars would somehow make the entitlement problem bearable. I don't think it would. Programmers frequently turn to the joy of open source exactly because it exists outside the normal employment dynamics of quid-pro-quo. That's the relief.I frequently argue that open source is best seen as a gift exchange, since that puts the emphasis on how to react as receiver of gifts. But if you're going to use another word as an alternative to community, I suggest you look at \"ecosystem\". Ecosystems aren't egalitarian. There are big fish and little fish. Sometimes the relationships are symbiotic, but they're also potentially parasitic.But whatever word you choose, you'd do well to remember that open source is first and foremost a method of collaboration between programmers who show up to do the work.

None of these kids ever got a diagnosis. They were all well within the spectrum of what constituted 'normal' back then. Today all of them would likely have acquired some label of pathology because nobody seems to qualify (or desire to be seen) as being normal these days. This is the natural consequence of 'centering the margins'. Of making it socially desirable to be not normal and low status to be regular. And it's happening across everything from gender expression to neurodiversity. There's cachet of cool to be had in identifying with some margin. Preferably one that can claim to be oppressed by society via heteronormativity or neurotypicality or other big words for 'normal'. And, as Abigail Shrier documents in Bad Therapy, there's a large industry of therapists and other 'mental health professionals' eager to accommodate this flight to the margins. Eager to supply the diagnosis, the pills, the reassurance of how every phase of experimentation or misbehavior can be explained by some big word of pathology. I think we've given up on something important in this pursuit of individuality through the spectrum of marginalization. When fitting is less about having the right brand of backpack and more about having some medical prescription. Whatever is at play, I think we're better off re-expanding the definition of normal to fit a much broader spectrum of quirky, weird, and natural varieties of humans.

Witness this tabulation of DEI (and ESG) mentions in earnings reports, reported by Business Insider. It's over. And thank heavens for that! This graph perfectly captures the temporary insanity of what those nutty years were really like in corporate America. An explosion of sanctimony, triggered by the fallacy that racial disparities in the office (and elsewhere) could only be explained by systemic racism. And, worse still, that the way to counteract this mirage was by compensatory discrimination against 'model minorities' (mostly Asians) and 'whiteness', as prescribed by the dogma of Antiracism. And with this explosion of sanctimony came a brief but suffocating culture of intimidation. Anyone who dared question the theology of high priests of this new religion, like DiAngelo or Kendi, were hounded and frequently banished by ideological thugs. It didn't matter if the hounded were low-level employees who hadn't kept up with latest woke dictionary (is it latinx now? or latine? or?), executives who dared to claim that meritocracy might actually be a good thing, or comedians making jokes about the insufferable fake piety of it all. There were pitchforks enough to chase all transgressors, big or small. But now it's done. The tide has turned. The People are sick of this shit. So that's it.

I mean, yes, the ad truly is awful. It symbolizes everything everyone has ever hated about digitization. It celebrates a lossy, creative compression for the most flimsy reason: An iPad shedding an irrelevant millimeter or two. It's destruction of beloved musical instruments is the perfect metaphor for how utterly tone-deaf technologists are capable of being. But the real story is just how little saved up goodwill Apple had in the bank to compensate for the outrage. That's because Apple has lost its presumption of good faith over the last five years with an ever-larger group of people, and now we've reached a tipping point. A year ago, I'm sure this awful ad would have gotten push back, but I'm also sure we'd heard more 'it's not that big of a deal' and 'what Apple really meant to say was...' from the stalwart Apple apologists the company has been able to count on for decades. But it's awfully quiet on the fan-boy front. This should all be eerily familiar to anyone who saw Microsoft fall from grace in the 90s. From being America's favorite software company to being the bully pursued by the DOJ for illegalities. Just like Apple now, Microsoft's reputation and good standing suddenly evaporated seemingly overnight once enough critical stories had accumulated about its behavior. It's not easy to predict these tipping points. Tim Cook enthusiastically introduced this awful ad with a big smile, and I'm sure he's sitting with at least some sense of 'wtf just happened?' and 'why don't they love us any more?'. Because companies like Apple almost have to ignore the haters as the cost of doing business, but then they also can't easily tell when the sentiment has changed from 'the usual number' to 'one too many'. And then, boom, the game is forever changed. I think this is bound to come as a bigger surprise to Apple than it would have almost any other company. Apple had such treasure chest of goodwill from decades as first an underdog, then unchallenged innovator. But today they're a near three-trillion dollar company, battling sovereigns on both sides of the Atlantic, putting out mostly incremental updates to mature products. Nobody is lining up with a tent to buy a new iPhone any more. The Vision Pro had at best a mediocre launch. Oh, and now the company is even the creator of cringy ads, introduced by a cringy CEO. Not that this is a mortal wound or even a story anyone is likely to remember in a month. But it is an early indicator that Apple's run on easy street is over. And that's going to require a new approach, which Apple probably won't embrace until they've embarrassed themselves a few more times (like they did with another cringe ad from a little while back).

I think we started with something like 400-600 attendees at the inaugural conference in Chicago in 2006, then just kept doubling year over year, as Rails went to the moon. If memory serves me right, we had something like 1,800 attendees in 2008? It was rapid, it was wild, but next year, it'll be over. RailsConf 2025 will be the last RailsConf. This is for the best. RailsConf, as it exists today, is a legacy from when the Rails ecosystem didn't have its own guardian institution. For many years, it was left to Ruby Central to fill this role, but that was always going to be a secondary pursuit to their primary mission of furthering Ruby in general. But now we have The Rails Foundation, which is focused 100% on Rails, backed by the biggest names in ecosystem. It's also the organizer of Rails World, which just sold out its own thousand-attendee conference in Toronto this coming September -- in less than twenty minutes! The baton has been passed. This is good. With Ruby Central focusing their efforts on general-purpose Ruby endeavors, like maintaining Bundler and RubyGems, as well as putting on RubyConf, the division of responsibilities between it and The Rails Foundation is now clear. Which makes it much easier for both organizations to collaborate on furthering Ruby on Rails, each putting emphasis on their side of the conjunction. I'm going to choose to remember RailsConf for all the wonderful memories it brought me and the ecosystem, especially in the early years. Working with the original crew of Chad Fowler, David A. Black, and Rich Kilmer was the treat of a lifetime. We bootstrapped something from nothing, turned it into an epoch-defining event, and I delivered some of my most memorable keynotes in that era. It's a bit of a shame what happened later, during those mad years in and immediately following the pandemic, but that kind of nonsense is thankfully now largely behind us, not just in the Ruby world, but in tech in general. And Ruby Central is now almost entirely run by people who didn't have anything to do with that debacle anyway. Making it much easier just to look forward, and simply appreciate that those odd years helped motivate finally getting The Rails Foundation off the ground. Either way, the future of Rails shines incredibly bright. The ideal of the one-person framework has never been more relevant. The world has woken up from the ZIRP years with a complexity hang-over, and Rails is the perfect painkiller. From #nobuild to bare-metal deployment to the eternal appeal of a full-stack solution comprised by Active Record, Action Pack, Active Support, and the million other arguments and assets that underpin the modern appeal of Rails. We never went away, but the renaissance is palpable none the less. So I raise my glass to the final RailsConf. Let's go out with a bang in 2025, celebrate the legacy, and then keep plucking away on spreading the joy of beautiful code, incredible productivity, and programmer-centric development with Ruby on Rails.

Perhaps it's a corollary to imposter syndrome, which leads programmers to believe that if a computer is operated by AWS or SaaS or literally anyone else, it must be more secure, better managed, less buggy, and ultimately purer. I wish that was so, but there are no magic machines and no magic operators. Just the same kind of potentially faulty bits and brains. A great example of this was the feedback to our declaration that [we're bringing continuous integration back to developer machines](https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-re-moving-continuous-integration-back-to-developer-machines-3ac6c611). The most common objection was to invoke \"it works on my machine\", as to imply that developer machines were somehow a different breed than the ones running in the cloud or the data center. They really aren't! The computer running tests remotely is indeed just that: Another computer. It isn't magical, and it's no less prone to be reliant on unaccounted for dependencies or environmental factors.In fact, when it comes to testing, it's a feature not a bug to have the suite run on multiple machines. It's like an extra fuzzy check that will uncover undeclared dependencies, and help you produce a more resilient system. Because even the best CI setup isn't production. And just because it works in CI doesn't mean it'll be free of issues in production. Which leads us to the whole point of testing systems in the first place: It's about confidence, not certainty. The road to programmer misery is paved with delusional aspirations that you can ever be fully, truly certain that any sufficiently complicated system will ever work as intended in production. All you have is degrees of confidence to trade-off against increasingly cumbersome protocols and procedures. There's no such thing as 100% test coverage that's meaningful and achievable at the same time. And it's the fundamental lack of confidence in their own abilities that lead programmers to think that the people operating their cloud computers are so much smarter or better than they are. They rarely are. They're just hidden, and it's that opaqueness that false implies a higher competence. If only you knew what kind of frazzled mechanical turk it takes to run most cloud institutions or SaaS operations, you wouldn't be so quick to doubt your own abilities. There's no magic class of computers and no magic class of computing clerics. \"It works on my computer\" is just the midwit version of \"it works on THAT computer\". It's all just computers.

My Intel 14900K-based Linux box can do that in less than half the time (and my M3 Max isn't that much slower!). So we're going to drop the remote runners and just bring continuous integration back to developer machines at 37signals. It's remarkable how big of a leap multi-core developer machines have taken over the last five-to-seven years or so. Running all these checks and validations in a reasonable time on a local machine would have been unthinkable not too long ago. But the 14900K has over 20 cores, the M3 Max has 16, and even a lowly M2 MacBook has 8. They're all capable of doing a tremendous amount of parallelized work that would have seem fantastical to do locally in the mid 2010s. HEY is a pretty substantial code base too. About 55,000 lines of Ruby code, which is verified by some 5,000 test cases along with another 300-some system tests. Virtually all of these tests go through the full-stack and hit the database. These are not mocked to the hilt. To me, the most satisfying part of the improved performance of modern developer CPUs is the possibility to simplify our stacks. Installing, operating, and caring for a remote CI setup is a substantial complication. Either you do it on your own hardware, and deal with that complexity directly, or you pay through the nose for a cloud-based setup. Getting to flush all of it down the simplification drain is an amazing step forward. In fact, it's what I like most about paying attention to the progress of our platforms. Oh, browsers now have really good JavaScript and CSS engines? Awesome. Let's go #nobuild. Oh, developer CPUs now have dozens of cores? Sweet. Let's pull CI home. Oh, single-core performance is way up? Wonderful. Let's drop gotcha-hinged accelerators like Spring. As always, the simplified future is not evenly distributed. I can't see the likes of Shopify or GitHub being able to run the full battery of tests against their millions of lines of code locally any time soon. But 99.99% of all web apps are much closer to HEY in breadth than they are to those behemoths. And small teams ought to remove all the moving parts possible. Never aspire to a more complicated stack than what your application calls for. So we need to keep burning those bridges of complexity once we get to the other side.

I've simply not been in the market for another computing platform in decades. Sure, I've dabbled a bit here and there, but never with true commitment. It wasn't until Cupertino broke my camel's back this year that I suddenly had the motivation needed to uproot everything. And when I did, I learned that Windows has turned into a wonderful web developer's platform thanks to the Windows Subsystem for Linux. I'm not going to lie and say I loved everything about Windows. But after the question of font rendering was settled, and I came to terms with giving up TextMate, it felt perfectly adequate. Better than adequate, actually. It felt nice. Nice knowing that there was a real, realistic, and compelling alternative to the mac, and that most of my aversion to Windows was based on outdated facts or misconceptions. So I made the commitment. Only to fall in love with a quirky piece of hardware from a small company called Framework shortly thereafter. That in turn lead to taking another look at running Linux outright, as the AMD chip inside the Framework simply punched harder with the penguin in charge. This coincided with a month-long trip away from home where all I brought was the Framework 13 running Ubuntu. And that taught me two things: Most of the jokes about Linux are true! There are more rabbit holes, more gotchas, and less polish. But I also learned, and this was the real surprise, that I scarcely minded at all! That in fact running Linux, and running into many of the little issues that often entails, was a surprisingly delightful and educational experience. As an example, I've been trying for a while to get my desktop PC, which has an Nvidia 4090 GPU, to work with my Apple XDR 6K monitor, which only accepts Thunderbolt 3. This involved sourcing an exotic Huawei DisplayPort + 2 USB-A => USB C cable. Then learning everything about monitor EDIDs, xorg.conf, kernel parameters, Nvidia driver versions, and about a million other topics that are very close to the metal and very far from the Apple experience (and I still haven't cracked the nut!). But rather than being frustrated with things not just working out of the box, I embraced the adventure. There's a certain nostalgia here, I'm sure. I grew up with computers that needed far more tender, love, and care to work well. Where IRQ conflicts had to be resolved before the SoundBlaster card would work for Wing Commander. Computers required some assembly, and as IKEA knows, it made us love them more. So here I am. I still have Windows available as a dual-boot option on the desktop, but the Framework 13 has been running Ubuntu exclusively the whole time, it's my daily driver at the moment, and now that I've acclimated, Linux just feels right. I love the Tactile windows manager for Gnome. I've figured out how to easily fill out my PDFs using Xournal++. Typora is giving me that iA Writer-like distraction-free typing experience I've come to love. And, for now, I've come to terms with VSCode. Would I recommend this expedition to everyone? No. I think if the idea of having to occasionally tinker with kernel parameters or display drivers give you nightmares, you probably shouldn't run Linux on your primary computer. But I'd also say that it's hard to know whether you'll find some zen of motorcycle maintenance in knowing how to tighten the timing chain of Ubuntu before you try. Especially if you've been cocooned inside the Apple bubble forever. For a lot of people, Windows is probably the better alternative to the mac. And that's great! We ought to have AT LEAST three good options for personal computing in the modern age, and now I've come to realize that we do. I'm just happy this exodus happened. I learned something new about myself. I tried a million combinations. And I discovered a real affinity for Framework and Ubuntu. I'd invite you to give it a go, if you're in the mood for a trek. Do it not because it is easy, but because it is hard. See what kind of computing stuff you're made of. Oh, and have fun!", "date": "2024-04-26T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Yes. Exactly. Modern office workers are often starved for ambition, adventure, and even discomfort. This is why there's an endless line of recruits willing to sign up to work for leaders like Musk, despite his reputation for being an erratic hard ass. The ambition is worth it. Because real ambition is rare.It's the lack of ambition that fuels the malaise of a bullshit job. Work so aspirationally underwhelming that it's possible to coast and imagine how the world wouldn't be an iota different if the work wasn't done. A perfect recipe for existential dread and despair. But while the stereotype of ambition is indeed someone like Elon Musk (or Steve Jobs, before that), I don't think you literally need to aim for Mars to stir the heart of sailors. Nor do I think you need to be as abrasive or demanding, as the stereotype implies. That's the balance we've been trying to find at 37signals since its inception: The vision of a calm company compatible with ambition. It's not always easy. If you talk for long enough about the fact that [40 hours a week ought to be enough](https://37signals.com/podcast/8s-enough-40s-plenty/), that vacations should be free of homing beacons, and how it literally [doesn't have to be crazy at work](https://basecamp.com/books/calm), people inside and out your company might soon think that's indeed all there is. That the ultimate goal of the company is to provide a cush and coasting existence. But that's not why I get out of bed in the morning. The aspiration of a calm company is to me exactly the opposite. To prove how much faster and further you can go if you [embrace constraints](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/03.4-embrace-constraints),[stay small](https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/small-is-not-a-stepping-stone/), and trust skilled professionals to[get the job done](https://basecamp.com/justletmedomyjob). That is, the calm company is a method for getting where we really want to go. It's not a destination in and of itself.In fact, I'd rather work in place where it was crazy all the time, if we're trying to get somewhere, than I'd work somewhere perfectly calm that's just spinning the wheels. But the point is that I don't think these objectives are in opposition. Being ambitious and calm is like being smooth and fast. Big, erratic, dramatic movements might feel like they're getting you somewhere, but the stop watch usually reveals the opposite. But what is ambition, exactly? To me, it's a leap of faith. A belief in the possibility of success without all the evidence to justify it a priori. A trust that whatever challenges we'll face between here and there, we'll be able to figure them out. It's a confidence in the strength of human ingenuity. And a bet that it takes a goal just beyond the reach of the plausible to get the best out of us all. That ambition can be applied to all aspects of a project. The timeline, the people, the problem, the tech. To tickle our sense of adventure, some of it has to be daring and bold. Maybe it's not enough people, not enough time, new tech, novel problems. Whatever it is, there must be an x factor, an unknown. If we can quantify it all before we even begin, the ambition disappears. And in that lack of certainly lies the discomfort, lies the leap. Betting on your ability to figure it out means taking a risk. Maybe you won't figure it out! Maybe we really didn't have enough people! Maybe we'll fail. But it's exactly the possibility of failure that gives the effort its meaning and its value. In the lore of Steve Jobs, you'll find plenty of anecdotes from people who really didn't care for how he treated them or their colleagues at times, but who still credit the projects they worked on for him at Apple as the most meaningful ones of their career. I'm sure the same is true with Musk. These encapsulate the paradox that, psychologically speaking, I don't think most people know what makes them fulfilled at work. (But it isn't the ping pong or the free massage.) Without a dash of the unpredictable, we all wither away. The chase for security and surety only works as a thrill if you never truly get there. Our competency only grows when we stretch it slightly beyond its breaking point from time to time. So keep calm, yes, but for all that is holy, carry on by being ambitious.", "date": "2024-04-25T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

This was back in the 1990s, the era of cutting off the air supply, of embrace-extend-extinguish, of open source as a cancer, and of Bill Gates before he sought reputational refugee in philanthropy. What made the animosity so strong was the sense of being trapped. That the alternatives to the Wintel monopoly of the time was so inferior as to essentially require giving up on modern computing. So when Apple released the first Unix-powered OSX machines at the turn of the millennium, I felt relieved. Saved, even. Finally -- FINALLY!! -- a real choice. Apple provided an escape hatch for computing without giving up on modernity, and I came to love them for it. But that was then and this is now. Microsoft has completed an astounding redemption arc since. They've gone from being the sworn enemy of open source to one of the biggest sponsors of it. They've been exemplary stewards of GitHub. They've won the hearts and minds of developers with VSCode fair and square. They've even put Linux inside of Windows with WSL! In short, they've gone from being a villain to a hero in a wide array of domains. Open source most of all. And I love it. They deserve all the accolades. Meanwhile, Apple... Well, I've talked enough about Apple. So let's talk about something new: Meta. I can't say I ever despised Meta, then Facebook, quite like I did Microsoft. But I sure as shit wasn't a fan. And I remain a staunch opponent of targeted advertising, the privacy assault that inevitably comes with them, and what it's done to the web. But I've come to appreciate that there are bigger challenges facing us than invasive ads. Much bigger. Take AI. Zuckerberg's embrace of open source AI, now making headlines with the public release of Llama 3, is an invaluable counter to the cartel-adjacent bullshit of AI safety & ethics that would see the likes of OpenAI and Google conspire with governments around the world to determine what math should be allowed to predict the next token. I've seen this movie before, and I'm not interested in a rerun. In fact, Facebook itself was one of the main characters in the previous show. The still going battle over misinformation/disinformation/malinformation, which continues to see the awful fusion of state and platforms through censors and algorithms in controlling The Narrative. Whatever trust I may once have had in objective third-party fact checkers have long since evaporated from the catastrophic track record of these anything-but-neutral, would-be arbiters of truth. I don't pretend that either of these problems are easy or even that they have solutions. But they certainly have different potential outcomes and trade-offs. Some worse than others. And the prospect of having AI exclusively fine-tuned by the likes of whoever did Gemini or directed by bureaucrats trying to save democracy by banning the opposition, yeah, no thanks. I'll take my chances with the unadulterated math or speech any day. Which makes Zuckerberg's transformation so important. I think a lot of the naivete he had, as did many, about the role of content moderation, truth arbiters, and platform control has been replaced by high degrees of skepticism. And I certainly think that after being humiliated by Apple via ATT, he's as motivated as anyone to prevent the next frontier of computing to be dominated by anyone (if it can't be himself!). This is good. And it's not good because I have some special insight into Zuckerberg's heart of hearts. I'm sure his dedication to open source AI is as motivated by self-interest as anyone in that position ever was. That's not a bug! It's a feature! Adam Smith saw it clearly in Wealth of Nations from 1776: It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages. We don't need altruism to save us, we need incentives. We need competition. We need free markets for products, platforms, services, ideas, speech, and AI. We need to put the locus of control with consumers and individuals, not bureaucrats and monopolists. That's always going to be the struggle. Whenever we achieve anything close to its ideal, like the marvel of the worldwide web, it constantly has to be guarded against regression. So if Microsoft proves to be aligned with some of those causes some of the time, I shall cheer them on, and I shall quell my quarreling. And if Meta does the same, they too shall receive my praise. (Or so I imagine Smith would sound!). We badly need more powerful champions and heroes of free markets and free thought. Enough that I'm more than willing to commute the sentencing of former villains who've served their time and changed their minds. And enough that I'm comfortable stack ranking my concerns about society, and realizing that targeted ads just aren't as important as the freedoms defined above. Let's go, Zuck.

So yesterday, I did two separate interviews with media outlets on the topic. And we spoke in part about those early weeks of reaction to our changes, as Twitter went crazy in response to the story. What was it like to briefly be the main, hated characters on the internet? In the moment, it was awful, but in retrospect, it was a gift. A gift as a mirror, causing me to reflect on how I might have been part of a similar mob, on other topics, in different ways. A gift of a misogi challenge of character, bringing the satisfaction of overcoming a vicious social purgatory. But above all, the gift of knowing who was there for me and who wasn't. It's a cliché, but 'knowing who your friends are' really is a blessing. We walk through life much of the time without really knowing who'll be there when the going gets tough -- and our guesses are often wrong. Only the moment of truth, a real crisis, can clarify who's who and what's what. And so it did for me. It brought unexpected friends and allies out in the light, and it revealed which friends and acquaintances would rather crawl back in the woodwork than stand by my side. I was surprised on both sides. But while I'll never forget who made what choice, I've committed myself to forgive those who trespassed against me. In that Mike Tyson'esque way of refusing to let any of them change me. I'm certain I've been the weak link in past situations from time to time. I'm certain I've been too lazy or too timid to reach out to support someone who I knew needed it. I don't have many regrets in life, but the ones I have usually fall into this category: I should have been there for someone. Beyond the personal, I think forgiving our trespassers is how we get out of this specific mess. The period from the late 2010s until at least 2022 really was crazy. It swept up so many otherwise kind and caring people into an ideology predicated on dividing us all into oppressors/oppressed, privileged/not, and other false dichotomies and identities. The way out of bad ideas like that is not a vendetta, but forgiveness. We all have the capacity for being swept up in a social movement or mob. But equally, we all have the path of finding our way out again. I think there are a lot of people sitting right now with a nagging sense of regret from what they partook in during that crazy era. Who tried on the cape of being a Social Justice Warrior, but ultimately found it suffocating both intellectually and culturally. That's the reckoning we're going through right now. The worst thing we can do to slow down the rejection of these bad ideas is by forever tarring people who were momentarily taken in by them. Yes, we should absolutely have a vigorous inquiry into the nature of these bad ideas, trace their lineage, and uncover their tragedies. But we can't persecute every individual who in a moment of fear, weakness or ignorance signed on to carry a torch because that's what everyone else was doing at the time. That is to say, it's more important that we expedite and complete the broad societal rejection of bad ideas than it is to pursue every bad actor until the end of the earth. That's exactly why this vicious ideology proved so unstable, and unable to retain the peak of its power. It kept eating its own for ever-smaller transgressions against an ever-shifting doctrine. To beat that nonsense back, the side of sanity has to do the opposite. Be broader, more forgiving, and less high strung. Lead us not into temptation of retaliation.", "date": "2024-04-23T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

This was just a bug! A problem with QA! It absolutely, positively wasn't a reflection of corrupted culture at Google, which now appeared to put ideology over accuracy. Really, really! Anyone watching that shit show would be right to wonder whether one of America's great technology companies had fallen completely into the hands of the new theocracy. I certainly did. But now comes evidence that Google perhaps isn't totally lost, even if an internal war over its origin principles is very much raging. One pitting the mission of organizing the world's information and making it useful against the newspeak Trust & Safety goal of controlling narratives and countering malinformation (i.e. inconvenient truths). This played out in stereotype as 28 Googlers occupied the CEO of Google Cloud's office for 10 hours this week, defaced property, and prevented other Googlers from doing their work. Because Google provides cloud services to Israel, said the occupiers. And thus The Current Thing demanded it be stopped by whatever means possible. But then the most amazing thing happened. There was no drawn-out investigation. No saccharine statements about employee's rights to occupy offices, preventing work from happening, or advance their political agenda at work. Nope. Bravo. They were just fired. Immediately. All 28 of them. Bravo. Google's bottom line? 'This is a place of business'. And while employees have the lawful right to protest their working conditions, they do not have the right to prevent a business from carrying out its normal course of commerce over a disagreement in politics. So that was that. But it gets better. Google followed up the unceremonious firings by calling an end to employees bringing their politics to the office. Just like Coinbase did, just like we did. The language was spot on: 'But ultimately we are a workplace and our policies and expectations are clear: this is a business, and not a place to act in a way that disrupts coworkers or makes them feel unsafe, to attempt to use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics. This is too important a moment as a company for us to be distracted.' Three years ago, taking a common-sense position like this would have been met with drama and outage in the media and on Twitter. Today I doubt it'll bring more than a ripple outside of a few activist echo chambers on Mastodon. Amazing progress! Note, none of this pertains to what you think about The Current Thing that provided the trigger this time. It could just as well had been BLM, Russiagate, climate change, or a million other hot-button topics that have occupied the role as The Current Thing, and been used to justify these kinds of insufferable activists yelling at their boss.

It's hanging out the back, swinging the car like a pendulum. And that's key to why it's the most iconic sports car ever made. This fundamental imperfection is part of how it creates the connection. This is true of mechanical watches too. They're hilariously complicated pieces of engineering that tell time worse than a $20 Casio quartz watch. And that's why we love them. The imperfection of timekeeping, the need to manually wind the things, cements the connection. That's how computers used to feel too. The Amiga, and the Commodore 64 before it, were quirky bread boxes. Using chips named things like Agnus, Alice, Denise, Lisa, and Paula. With clicking, whirring disk drives. The flickering screen when software was loading. As distinctly different from the competition as a Porsche flat-six is from a Ferrari V12. But the quirky is almost all gone from modern day computers. The mac in particular has been massaged to within an inch of perfection, and has thus become harder to connect with. It's a curious contradiction. We strive to make things better and better, but if we succeed, we reminisce of the quirks that used to be. The last MacBook I really loved was the original 11\" MacBook Air. It was full of compromises. A cramped screen. Chips that weren't quite fast enough. An iconic, wedgy design. It was so good because it was also kinda bad. I thought that era was simply gone. But over the last month or so, I've developed much of the same affection for the Framework 13. Exactly because of all it's compromises and it's quirky design choices.It uses an odd 3:2 display, which is almost as tall as it is wide. In a time when most every other maker has gone 16:9 or 16:10. And it's matte, not glossy. The keyboard has twice the travel of most modern laptops. Giving it almost a vintage feel, which, once you get used to it, is really addictive. It has interchangeable ports?! You can configure the 4 slots with every combination of USB C, USB A, ethernet ports, HDMI ports, and additional storage you desire. Then swap them quickly and easily. An ingenious alternative to dongle life. And to top it off, I've chosen to run Linux on mine full time. I started out dual booting with Windows, but quickly realized that Linux ran faster on this AMD 7840U chip, and I found that Linux gave me everything I needed in more of that quirky style that gives the Framework machine its appeal in the first place. Those are all the good parts, but there are plenty of drawbacks too. Compared to a modern MacBook, the battery is inferior. I got 6 hours in mixed use yesterday. The screen is only barely adequate to run at retina-like 2x for smooth looking fonts. Linux is far less polished than macOS. But somehow it just doesn't really matter. First of all, 6 hours is enough for regular use. If I'm doing more than that in a single stint without getting up, I'll be paying for it physically anyway. And the somewhat cramped resolution has made me fall in love with full-screen apps again, like I used to do with that 11\" MacBook Air. But this is all picking at the parts when the grand story is the sum. This quirky, flawed machine has created a connection I haven't had with a piece of physical computer hardware in a very long time. That's notable! I know this testimony isn't likely to appeal seriously to most mac users. Just like it wouldn't really have appealed to me a year or two ago. I just wasn't in the market for a change. And that's fine. Apple makes really, really good computers these days. Damn near perfect ones. And most people don't care that the 911 has the engine in the back. In fact, they don't care about cars at all, really. They just want to get from A to B, as quickly, cheaply, and smoothly as possible. And they tell time perfectly from their smart phone display. This is the democratization of progress. Wonderful. But if you're the kind of person who might appreciate a slightly notchy manual gearbox, the click of a mechanical shutter on a camera, the ticking of the escapement in a watch, or, dare I say it, putting on a vinyl record, you should checkout the Framework 13. The AMD version starts at just around a thousand bucks. So it's not like you have to switch your whole computing life around to give it a try. And, if you're a programmer, I think you should actually give Linux a try as well. I've smirked about \"This Is The Year of Linux on the Desktop\" for over twenty years, but now that I've been actually running it for over a month, I've realized it's actually here. And probably has been for quite a while. I just run Ubuntu 23.10, and together with ulauncher+tactile, it's a delightful desktop experience (see my whole Ubuntu setup script). I even found a replacement for my beloved iA Writer in Typora!Make no mistake, there's more fuss. More snags, more imperfections. So if you go in expecting the same level of perfection you'd get from company worth three trillion, you might be disappointed. But if you consider this the work of a worldwide open source community, it's incredible how close it is in most areas, ahead in a few, and not that far behind in the rest. Dare to add a little imperfection into your computing setup, and you might just find a deeper connection to the bits and electrons running it all.

It's in this realm the real monsters appear. Without enough real problems to go around, humans are prone to invent fictitious and dreadful ones. This is the root of David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs analysis. That a shocking percentage of people work jobs that they themselves see little to no meaning in, because the work that's being produced makes no difference, has no essence. It's enough to make anyone mad.Now part of the problem is clearly one of perspective. I'm always amazed by the pride and duty it appears most Japanese workers put into the most mundane jobs. I forget where I read this, but it's the difference between being a happy zoo keeper who think of their job as 'tending to the welfare of the elephants' rather than just 'shoveling shit all day'. But it's not all subjective either. We are biologically tuned to conserve energy while being cognitively tuned to crave a challenge. So when the load is material, we often wish it was lighter. But if we actually succeed in lightening the load, we wonder why we're unhappy. This is one of those contradictory aspects of the human condition, and one that's foolish to attempt to resolve. The trick I've found is to believe both things to be true at the same time. Yes, occasionally there's a need to rest and conserve energy. But equally so, there's a need to get back into the arena, and wrestle with something significant. Mojito island, all the time, is a curse, not a blessing. And in fact, it probably is worse, for most people, to have too many stretches of too little to do than the opposite. Tales of workers dropping dead a year into retirement is a common folklore expression of this knowledge. All this to say: don't slice the few, meaningful problems you have at work too thin. The worst injury you can inflict on knowledge workers is leaving them with too little of consequence to contest with. Meaningful problems are the most valuable human motivators. Made-up problems are a blight. Ensure you have not quite enough time and people available to tackle the former lest you start inventing the latter.", "date": "2024-04-11T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Because it's obviously not true, and it's usually cynically invoked by management to entice an undue obligation of sacrifice. Implying that you should give it all to The Company -- constantly working weekends, always being available on vacations, and all the rest -- but when the necessities of the business change, you'll realize the obligation was never truly mutual.So far, so agreeable to most people. They usually already have a family. They're not looking to supplant it with a fake corporate version. And they don't need to. Work can and should be friendly, fun, and rewarding without the blood relations. But if work is not a family, what is it then? I think Netflix got it right: it's a professional team. One where colleagues earn a spot by being really good in their given position. But also -- and this is the hard part! -- one where someone may fail to make the cut, if they aren't up to the standards of the team, don't fit in the given position, or simply hasn't been playing well enough for a while. You can't have it both ways. You can't scorn the use of \"we're a family\" and then also expect that colleagues who can't keep up are spared the cut. It's either or, if you're going to have a high-performing team. Think of it this way. There are millions of people playing soccer in the world and having fun. There are probably thousands who play at some level of professionalism. But there are only 11 spots on the starting lineup of Manchester United. You can be very good at soccer, and still not be part of that lineup. Now the natural delusion of every business owner is to think that they're running Manchester United when in fact they're barely hanging on in third division. But the point is actually the same. Even in third division, there's a level of competence that makes someone a good fit. We can't all be the best. But there's room for almost anyone who's half-way decent to play (or work) productively SOMEWHERE. And the reality is that if someone is a fit for third division, they'd have a terrible time on that Manchester United starting lineup. The expectations would be sky high. The gaps in their competency would quickly and painfully be revealed. They'd soon realize they're in the wrong place. Cutting them from the team would be an act of mercy, not cruelty. Note that it's more than fine to give someone who shows promise a chance in a position that seems like a stretch. But after a couple of games, the progress should be apparent. Either you're revealing the fact that they're quickly stepping up to the role or you're revealing the fact that they won't. Both are valuable learnings, but not if you squander the insight, and don't act accordingly. This is perhaps the most important job of the coach or manager. Knowing when to make the cut, and having the strength to do it. There'll always be a million reasons, especially if someone is well-liked, why you should wait longer, be more patient. But to do the job of being in charge well, you have to be decisive in face of incomplete evidence. Not everyone is meant to be Messi or to play on his team. But we wouldn't have much of a sport if his level was the only level. Find your level, find a team that fits with it, and play to the best of your ability.

The first time I showed up on the grid at Le Mans was in 2012 -- some five years after I had first driven a real race car, and even less time since I made participating in the world's greatest endurance race the ultimate goal. But it almost didn't happen this year. See, motorsports relies on a curious mix of money and talent. It's usually not enough just to be good at driving to get a seat in a competitive car. The majority of teams competing, certainly in sports car racing, either are or have been funded by passionate privateers who bring the budget to make racing possible. Even in Formula 1 is this part of the dynamic. I bring some of the money and some of the talent, but never enough to single-handedly make a program worthy of a Le Mans entry happen. I have to team up with other drivers who bring another part of the budget, and a bit more talent, as well as some drivers who just bring their peak talent. Oh, and find a team that preferably has a few sponsors to close the gap. It's always a dance. And this year, it seemed like the dance wasn't going to close. Plenty of conversations, plenty of ideas, but no contract, no signatures. Until suddenly, a few weeks ago, a driver dropped out of their contract, and voila, a seat with Nielsen Racing for the European Le Mans Series and the 24 Hours of Le Mans was available for me to fill. Nice!But it's a weird time in sports car racing. On the one hand, this will be perhaps the most exciting 24 Hours of Le Mans ever, in terms of high-profile manufacturer involvement. We'll see competition between Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini, Toyota, Cadillac, BMW, Peugeot, and Alpine this June in France. No wonder the race has been sold out since November. On the other hand, nobody seems to know what the future of the car is going to look like. Is everything going electric? Will AI be driving us all around shortly? Who's going to reap the spoils of this transformation: Software makers in Silicon Valley or battery makers in China? Where does this leave the historic motoring brands of Europe? You'd think this level of uncertainty about the future would have dampened the will among car makers to spend lavishly on big-budget racing programs. And yet we're at an all-time high for both Formula 1 and sportscar racing. It's curious. Not that I'm complaining, mind you. It's rather amazing to be able to participate in such a golden era of motorsport. To be able to show up to the Super Bowl or Wimbledon or World Cup finals of our sport, as an amateur, and compete with the best drivers in the world. What a privilege. Even more so because I know this isn't going to last forever. I was 32 when I first drove at Le Mans. Now I'm 44. Drivers don't get better after forty, that's just a fact. Most have already retired by then, actually. Fernando Alonso, at 42, being the exception that proves the rule. So I keep waiting for my dip to come any minute now. For the lap times to fall off, first a little, then a lot. Or for the incident rate to increase. There's just no fighting nature, it will happen. But perhaps because I don't have that peak talent, I'll be spared a little longer. Be given a few more races at the top of my game, before the inevitable decline comes. I don't say that with any trepidation. I'm at peace with the circle of life, its array of inevitable declines, and with its finality. Nobody gets to be their best at almost anything forever, certainly not in the physical realm, and none of us will make it out of alive. If anything, there's a sense of relief in knowing that none of it -- not racing, not programming, not entrepreneurship -- is meant to go on forever. Perhaps this is an easier existential pill to swallow once you've had kids. Seeing my three boys get quicker in their gokarts, whether they'll eventually turn it into car racing or not, tastes like the saying 'when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in'. Now we're really off track, but that is perhaps one of the most rewarding aspects of having children. This biologically-infused acceptance of finality. I don't have to live forever, because the human lineage I'm a part of, and that's millions of years old, is going to continue. Whether they'll be racing cars or not. But that brings us back to one of my favorite parts about driving a race car real fast: There's no time for existential deliberation! All your attention must be focused on making the perfect inputs for the next corner, lest you give up a tenth of a second or make a mistake that sends you and the car into the wall. Everything else simply must vanish for your attention to be devoted to the task at hand: Go fast, don't crash. June 14-16, then. For 24 hours.

So many kids with a diagnosis of one sort or another, so much monitoring of children's every move, so much anxiety over the most trivial things, like the sugar content of a cupcake. Abigail Shrier ties all these threads together into a damning tapestry of well-cited arguments for why much of modern parenting in America is failing the kids it purports to care for so catastrophically. I simply couldn't put it down. I've read a few parenting books, and I usually have to somewhat dig to find something to take away. But Bad Therapy required no digging. It is unusually dense with eye-opening and deeply resonating take-aways. From its diagnosis to its anecdotes. It's also depressing. That this is what's become of the modern American childhood experience in so many places. The almost fully eroded sense of childhood independence, with its moderate dangers and teaching moments. Replaced with cotton-ball cocoons to keep kids from dealing with even the most minor of setbacks themselves. Lest accusations start flying of how somebody, somewhere OUGHT TO HAVE DONE SOMETHING. It's without a doubt the worst thing about living in America for me at the moment. The hyper-active, hyper-involved parents who have hair-trigger intervention fingers ready to be pulled at the slightest appearance of social discomfort or disharmony. Eager to do calls, follow-ups, and long threads of texting to \"unpack\" whatever happened between so and so in the playground at recess. Placated by administrators and teachers all too eager to assume greater involvement with every living millisecond and millimeter of school life. Combined with the fact that we, me, us are all complicit. All so easily sucked into it all. I hate it. Which is how Shrier's book emerges like such an oasis in the middle of a desert of such arid ideas. From \"gentle parenting\", to social-emotional-learning programs, to trauma-me-this-and-trauma-me-that thinking, it's all seemingly spreading everywhere. So this forceful refutation of the lot of it quenches a deep thirst for opposition. And boy does it deliver! It's delightfully polemic, with pointed and named refutations of the specific intellectuals who are at the center of advancing these bad ideas. It reads like it was written by a writer entirely unafraid of slaughtering the sacred cows of the upper-class zeitgeist. Because it is! In 2020, Shrier wrote Irreversible Damage, about the dramatic surge in transgender identification, and the medical interventions and experiments that have come with it. It was so controversial that it made one of the leading lawyers at the ACLU, Chase Strangio, tweet that \"stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100% a hill I will die on\". Yikes. So to say Shrier has been through the cancellation ringer is an understatement of epic proportions. Her first appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast even prompted a fringe of Spotify employees to protest the company's sponsorship of the podcast. But Shrier made it through. And there is perhaps nothing quite as fortifying as staring down a censorship mob, and then later seeing your testimony confirmed. See the WPATH Files or the NHS' reversal on puberty blockers, as just two examples validating the concerns raised in that book.No wonder Bad Therapy has instantly become a best seller. Regardless of your parenting approach, I think you'll be forced to think long and hard about it after reading Shrier's book. It's all but ensured to push some buttons in almost everyone. When it does, don't quit it, stick with it. The message couldn't be more timely. The mental health statistics on kids and young adults today are horrifying. What American parents have been doing for the last twenty-plus years is so resoundingly not working. All the therapy, the accommodations, the pills, and the interventions have failed to produce a generation of happy, independent kids. It's way overdue for thee parents, us parents, to go back to drawing board. There's no way the answer is more of the same. You gotta read it.", "date": "2024-03-31T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Set the pace Not only does work easily expand to fit the time allotted, but our ambitions will shrink along with our declining productivity. The slower you're moving, the less you think you can do, the slower you're moving. The only counter to this is to be ambitious, bold, and impatient. Again, this doesn't mean cracking the whip over a herd of cubicled programmers zombieing their way through yet another death march day on a 12-hour shift. Setting the pace isn't about demanding more hours, it's about demanding more It's also about constantly questioning the premise of the work. Why are we doing it this way? Could it be done differently? Are you prepping for contingencies that are too remote to matter? Or are you not spending enough time where it really counts? The only way to tell is by knowing the work. Executives who drift high up in the clouds have a hard time seeing the terrain. You can only get so much information second-hand or from outdated maps. You have to be there to know. So to be bold, you must have insight – or you're just delusional. Credibility is built on pushing for a reach and then actually making it.

You have to take it personal, to some degree. It has to offend your sensibilities when things are not right, to some degree. Because you need that energy to halt the work and redo what isn't right when you find out. If you let it slide, if you don't sweat, eventually nobody else will. And holding the line on quality isn't just about the customer experience, it's about everything. It's about writing code that'll be a joy to read in three years. It's about giving support staff enough policy leeway to deal with problems (without giving the farm away). It's about making sure none of the writing that's signed by the company makes you cringe.

Au contraire. My concern is rather that the sovereign leviathans of the world, be it the EU or the US, might not exactly share as many interests with free market advocates as it appears on the surface. Let's start with the Digital Markets Act. That's the main antitrust battering ram hitting the gates of Apple's keep at the moment. And Apple doesn't seem to know what's up, down, or any which way around. They're stumbling from Apple is finally getting a dose of its own infuriating medicine! It's fumbling in the dark trying to comply with vague, ambiguous rules that seem designed for maximum frustration. And it can't seem to get a straight answer from said authorities on exactly what it'll take to be legal. It has to invent a myriad of APIs and policies up front, only then to be told what will be accepted (or not) after the fact. Welcome to But once I've let the dark delight subside, I must return to my principles. The reason developers are so frustrated with the app store monopolies is exactly the absence of clear rules that are consistently and predictably enforced. We want a In the best case scenario, this awful DMA adventure that Apple is currently struggling through will be a mirror for the company to reflect on its own behavior. And, having felt exactly that sense of intolerable frustration shared by countless developers, they'll use the introspection to reconsider their extractive ways. Yes, that's very much wishful thinking. But I refuse to stop hoping, because if you give up on hope, you're bound to become cynical, and that's a curse worse than any commercial dispossession. But let's return to the biggest potential threat here. Not from Apple, not from Google, but from the sovereign leviathans. The legislatures, the courts, and the rest of the governmental machinery slowly churning their big grinding gears in the US and the EU. The DMA is convoluted and complicated because the EU is trying to have its cake and eat it too. It purports to open markets and ensure competition, but at the same time embrace the power of consolidation by co-opting Apple's (and Google's) reach and gatekeeper privileges. This latter motive is what governments on both sides of the Atlantic have been pursuing for the internet since day one. To bring it under their control. You see this with the scarily And here's the kicker. These laws need implementation, and no process has proven more effective than deputizing the likes of Apple, Google, Amazon, and other Big Tech platform owners. Making them responsible for carrying out the censorship. Whether that takes the explicit form of official laws and their invocation, like the dystopian financial crackdown on Now I know that as soon as we dive into the specifics, like the Canadian trucker protests or Parlor or anything else from those divisive archives, this whole debate turns into a partisan team sport. Whatever lofty principles people hold in the abstract are quickly sacrificed, if there's a chance to score a win against the opposing side. This is when labels fly freely, and suddenly everyone is a nazi or a communist. But whatever side you're on (or whether you take a side at all!), you ought to recognize that the rings of power usually change side every now and then. Every overreach you find justified when its your team wielding the advantage is one you'll rue when it's turned back against you. I think even the most hardcore partisans actually know this, even if they're loathe to admit it. It's why you have a parade of Democrats in the US chasing Trump with every bogus legal claim under the sun while fretting that he'll \"weaponize the courts to pursue his political enemies\", if he wins this November. Pots and kettles, all black. (Yes, again, I recognize that mentioning Trump will completely shut off the frontal lobes of half the audience, if references to Canadian truckers or Parlor didn't do the job already. But the hypocrisy is just too grand to ignore. Regardless of whether you think Trump is a once-in-a-century villain or not.) All this is why reasonable people might well just Emergency powers invoked when honking horns got too much. Misinformation missions expanding to include malinformation too (true information that's unhelpful/damaging to the cause/narrative). Political opponents labeled as traitors and in cahoots with foreign adversaries. I think it's perfectly reasonable to worry how a ban/forced sale of TikTok might pave the way for similar actions against That's the context in which I worry about what comes next in the fight against Big Tech monopolies. A future where this intolerable concentration of power is not so much disbanded as simply subsumed into the growing arsenal of oppressive powers that are increasingly being collected by Western democracies. All in the name of fighting the ever-expanding list of forbidden words and I want to see the monopolies of Apple and Google addressed. And I also think the leviathans are our best bet in the short term, but I'm open to the idea that the short term isn't worth selling out our principles for in the long term. That maybe we ought to place our faith in There's one version of history that holds that it was the Justice Departments case against Microsoft that opened up the tech world to new entrants in the early 2000s. That without their intervention, we'd been doomed to live with the But there's another version that sees the inherently disruptive force of the internet, the rise of Firefox, then Chrome, together with Google, Facebook, and the rest of that eras challenges to Microsoft, as happening without the intervention of the leviathan. And that those same forces, and the nature of playing successive rounds of the prisoner's dilemma, is Usually, I find it relatively easy to navigate such questions and counterfactuals to arrive at a position worth going all-in on.

On the one hand, If you zoom out, though, developers are still flying high on tailwinds that took them to the moon over the past decade. Yes, hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs in the tech industry, but the preceding hiring bonanza still leaves us with an enormous and wealthy industry. And the wage gains secured during the go-go days are still massive, despite what inflation has eroded over the last few years. Contrast the fortunes of premium programmers in 2024 with their situation from 2014 or 2008, and they're still looking mighty privileged. But humans don't react to absolute status or wealth. All the anxiety or exhilaration is in the delta. Are we moving up or down? Forwards or backwards? And right now, except for a tiny group of gilded AI wizards, most programmers have either seen their prospects stalled or become more precarious. So yesterday's wins are quickly pushed aside by tomorrow's worries. There's some irony in this change of fortune. Programmers, as a group, have prospered tremendously by automating other people's jobs over the past half century. But when it's other people's livelihoods, we naturally have a much easier time seeing the big picture. That the aggregate prosperity of the world improves as productivity goes up. It's a little harder when it's your own profession feeling the pressure. It's hard to tell how real that pressure actually is, though. Okay, the layoffs are indisputable, and the tough hiring environment an inevitable consequence. But the wreckage of the dot-com bust was cleared in a few short years, and then it was back to full steam ahead. And exuberant tech analysts told cabbies in 2017 that self-driving cars were going to put them all out of a job in a hot minute. That still hasn't happened either. That's the trouble with The Future. It's awfully difficult to predict when it'll actually arrive. All we're doing is making bets and taking guesses. My guess would be that just like agriculture went from requiring the participation of 97% of the world's population in the age of subsistence farming to the mere 2% required for our industrial processes today, so too will go the way of the programmer. That is, I do think we've probably seen the high-water mark of the manual programmer. That maybe our industry and employment charts might look like the Tokyo stock market when we look back from the future. Sideways since the 90s. Now that still leaves an enormous industry with plenty of prospects, of course. If anything, AI is likely going to make the tech industry even more integrated in society and thus more valuable. But we just might not need as many human programmers pounding code with their little meat fingers. Just like the aggregate value of the agricultural industry has gone up a lot since the pre-industrial era, even if the number of hands in the field have shrunk to almost nothing. So while it's hard to do, it's useless to worry. The Future is out of your hands and out of your control. No profession has ever successfully resisted automation or redundancy in the face of technological advancement over the long term.

Here's the old paragraph: Radical Candor is the concept of ruinous empathy.

In fact, I cringe when I now read this. The idea that employees are so mentally fragile that \"feeling overwhelmed\" is a reason to be absent is bonkers. Everyone feels \"overwhelmed\" every now and then. That's not an adequate reason not to show up for work! Could you imagine if the rest of the world ran on something like this? That your trash cans wouldn't get emptied if the truck driver \"felt overwhelmed\"? No. Just no. Not every day is going to be magical at work. Some days you really do just have to power through. And if you can't, then use some paid time off to recover. Taking it out of the same allowance that someone else would spend on a holiday. In fact, I've come to believe that this type of language and expectation setting actually makes people more fragile. That it plants the idea that working in front of a computer is so mentally taxing that almost nobody can bear it without the occasional \"mental health day\". That's just not true, and it's not helpful. Getting rid of this nonsense is part of how we've been scrubbing the precious out of the organization. And we've been far better off for it over the past few years. That doesn't mean scrubbing out caring. It doesn't mean turning into a hard ass. The opposite of precious is not being cruel, but being clear. It's expecting a reasonable baseline from people that anyone out in ThE ReAL wORlD could recognize as fair. Being too precious is the same as being fragile. That's not a goal to aspire to. We should all be chasing higher resilience instead.", "date": "2024-03-12T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

The company made one of the smartest acquisitions in tech when If it wasn't all so terribly dark and sad, it would actually be funny. In pictures and texts, it ironically made the point of the \"AI safety\" crowd incredibly well, but in the opposite direction. The threat from AI will come less from \"perpetuating existing biases in the world\" and more from \"injecting the biases and ideology of its overseers\". How on earth Google could release something so twisted, so wrong to the world? The company's executives, as well as Google co-founder Sergei Brin, tried to brush it off as \"bugs\", but few people bought that story. It seemed more likely that Gemini was working just fine by But this part of the story has already been diagnosed to death. Gemini was a catastrophic, confidence-shattering launch. It also caused Google's stock price to take quite the dive. Presumably because it called into question whether all of those investments and years of research will ultimately be squandered on a futile search for cosmic justice. Investors are right to worry. The part that's even more fascinating to me than the hilarious broken product is what kind of organization could possibly design and release such an abomination to the world. The answer came courtesy of While the rest of tech has But I can totally see how they got there. How Sergei and Larry could feels like it's too late, too hard, too painful to deal with the cultural capitulation. Because that's almost how Jason and I felt at times prior to April 2021, when some of the same forces and sentiments were spreading inside our own company. The Pirate Wires report was entitled \"Google's Culture of Fear\", and that's exactly what it felt like at times at our company leading up to April 2021. That the ship was being forced in a bad direction, by bad actors, with bad ideas, but that if you were going to question the compass, there'd be hell to pay. Both internally and externally. You were going to be called names. Accused of horrible things. And, really, do you want to deal with all that right now? Maybe it'd be easier to just let dragons lie. But the problem with ideological dragons like this is that they're never content with the political scalps or capital accumulated. There's always a hunger for more, more, more. Every little victory is an opportunity to move the goal posts further north. Make ever smaller transgressions punishable by ostracization and shame. Label even bigger swaths of normal interactions and behaviors as \"problematic\". It just never fucking ends. That is unless you say \"enough\". Enough with the nonsense. Enough with the witch hunts. Enough with the echo chamber. So I totally get why Sergei and Larry might have more than a little trepidation about rocking the boat. Google appears to be so deeply captured at this point, the rot has been left to fester for so long, that it's going to be extraordinarily painful to correct now. On the other hand, there's more cover. The worst of the woke scourge has indeed passed in tech. Plenty of other companies have now If I were a betting man, I'd bet it's going to happen, though. Maybe not as spectacularly and decisively as we did it at our company, with one clean cut. But gradually, like most major corporations have wound down the woke excesses while pretending it's all just a correction for \"over hiring\". What's clear to me is that addressing this is existential to Google. Just like it was existential for us. If you follow these bad ideas to their logical conclusion, you end up with worse than useless products. You end up with a search engine that wants to lecture people rather than finding the facts. There's no mainstream market for such a bullshit product in the long run. Eventually the market will force the correction. But Google is a very rich company. It could coast on the fumes of its former glory for a long time. Let's hope that there's more than an empty, hollowed out shell of a company left by the time they get this right and return to sanity. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm actually rooting for Google on this one. Big tech is a game of thrones, and all us mere peasants are better off when the big powers all counter each other in a variety of ways. We need a stronger Google to counter a strong Apple and a strong Microsoft. So. Hard choices, easy life. Easy choices, hard life. We made some incredibly hard choices in April of 2021. We've lived a comparably very easy life on that vector ever since we finished the cleanup. Sergei and Larry, you guys can do it too. But you have to want to do it. You have to want Google to be relevant in AI. You have to want to make the world's information accessible and useful again, without the ideological nonsense.

Thus it's a strange but wonderful feeling to be running Ubuntu 22.04 under the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and finding everything so beautifully integrated and super fast. To see VSCode as a fully open source project, thriving without the coercion of a platform mandate, and winning the hearts and minds of developers on a level playing field. And, of course, to see Microsoft with the smartest card in all of AI in their deck. Oh, and as excellent stewards of GitHub! And then you look at Apple. Sure, they're making gobs of money these days, like Ballmer did so well during his time, but, also like Ballmer, they're anchored in an aggrieved past. One that includes a self-image of a persecuted victim in the antitrust arena, one which just can't seem to get the love and respect from builders on its platforms that it believe it rightly deserves. One that would write shit like this in an actual press release: A large part of Spotify's success is due to the App Store, along with all the tools and technology that Spotify uses to build, update, and share their app with Apple users around the world. We’re proud to play a key role supporting Spotify’s success — as we have for developers of all sizes, from the App Store’s earliest days. Yes, that's literally Apple taken credit for Spotify's success in response to the EU fining them $1.8 billion for illegal practices. After all the malfeasance and self-preferencing Apple employed to help Apple Music unfairly gain ground against Spotify. It's truly an incredible document. One that I hope marks the sad high water point for Apple's hubris. One we'll point to once this cast of executives currently steering the ship finally depart their positions. Because I've increasingly come to the conclusion that nothing will fundamentally change at Apple until they have the kind of leadership transition that unlocked so much value at Microsoft. Until they find their Nadella to replace their Ballmer, we should expect more indignant press releases, more threats, more evasion, more malicious compliance. I've referred to this antitrust deposition of Bill Gates from 1998 before. It's an ugly video. Microsoft and Gates at their very worst. And it's incredible how similar the posture of Gates and the posture of Apple's writing in that press release on the Spotify verdict shimmers with the same light. But look at Microsoft now. They've managed to literally get to the top of the world while also engaging with the broader development community in an incredibly productive way. Does that make Microsoft perfect? Of course it doesn't. Nor does it erase our collective memory of what it once was. But today - right here, right now - they're a model for what Apple could become. Oh, and for all the shit Ballmer gets, and much of it is deserved, I will give him that he knew the value of DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS. Maybe now that he's in his golden years, he could pass on some of that wisdom to his fellow boomer, Tim Cook. Or maybe just tell him about how good retirement actually is, and perhaps recommend a sports team that Cook could buy to pass the time. Either way, Apple needs a cultural reboot.", "date": "2024-03-05T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

I'm typing this on a 32\" 6K monitor running at 200% in Windows 11 using I did not know this!! To make matters worse, I just spent last week using a PC on a 27\" 4K monitor (163 PPI) where I accidentally committed the other common cardinal sin that make fonts look like shit on any system: Fractional scaling. I had the screen set to 150%. No wonder it looked offensively bad compared to the Mac! You can't split a pixel, so the system has to do all sorts of typographically nasty tricks when doing non-integer scaling, and the end result is awful font rendering. But none of this is actually Windows' fault, per se. It's all about the hardware. Apple has the power to enforce retina-class displays across its entire lineup, so as a result everyone who looks at a Mac sees beautifully rendered fonts. Windows, on the other hand, runs on everything from rinky-dingy $200 laptops with super low-resolution screens and up to the best computers money can buy. You're quite likely to see a PC with awful fonts because it just doesn't have the hardware to do better.

So it's a trade-off. This lovely 6K Pro Display is great for text, great for photography, great for video, but not so great for gaming, since it tops out at 60hz/60fps.

Nothing crazy. You don't need 8K (unless maybe you're trying to swing a 40\" monitor), but you do need retina-style PPI counts. Apple has set some good rules of thumb here with their 3 desktop displays. The 24\" runs 4.5K, the 27\" runs 5K, and the 32\" runs 6K. That's all right on the money of that 218 PPI retina target. Their 14\" MacBook Pro even runs a native resolution of 3024x1964, giving it a very impressive 254 PPI. That's the bar, if you want similar looks.

That means a pixel-per-inch count in excess of 218. High enough that you can't see the individual pixels with the naked eye. With a high-resolution display like that, you can run it at 2x or 200%. So a 27\" 5K Apple Studio Display (218 PPI) that runs natively at 5120x2880 can run at 2x and give you the equivalent of a 2560x1440 workspace, but with much nicer rendering. And that's the magic.

Partly because most of the people I talk to on a regular basis are either international travelers or live in Europe, so WhatsApp is already their default. I had actually been the weirdo using iMessage with a bunch of people who preferred WhatsApp! After that, I realized that all the major social apps and utilities I use simply have Android versions that are as good as the iOS counterparts. I kinda knew that, but living with the phone as my primary really hammered it home. It really doesn’t matter whether you run X or TikTok or Instagram or YouTube on iPhone or Android. You won’t be able to tell the difference in most cases. I was pleasantly surprised by Android Auto as well. It’s actually nicer than CarPlay! I find that it connects to the cars I have quicker, the music starts playing sooner, the integration with Signal and WhatsApp is nicer, Spotify looks better, and Google understands my voice commands more often than Siri. And of course there’s the added bonus that my Samsung will let me play Fortnite with the kids. You have to install the apk file The switch also made me cancel the Apple One bundle that I still had. The kids never really liked any of the games on offer with Apple Arcade, I never found any shows worth the time on Apple+, and I always did prefer Spotify’s playlists and UI to Apple Music (even though it’s annoying we still don’t have lossless in 2024!!). Which has left me with the one Apple service that I’m finding it the hardest to quit: Apple Photos. And I’m thinking it’s really just because I have to jump to Google Photos. Export the 150GB of photos, import it over there, and get it done. Then find a different way to share photos with family still on iOS somehow. But I wish there was a non-Google version that was as good as either Apple Photos or Google Photos. Maybe I should also give Dropbox another look for photo management! But that was it? All the old pet peeves I had about Android has been resolved: Scroll acceleration is now great. Font rendering is now very good (I wish Microsoft would poach some font people from Android or macOS!). And, finally, FINALLY, the Snapdragon chips have caught up enough that it just isn’t a meaningful difference (200+ on Speedometer 2.1 is Good Enough). The Samsung hardware is also excellent. With the S24+, you get a 6.7” phone that weighs just 196g. That’s basically the same as the 6.1” iPhone 15 Pro, and a lot lighter than the bigger iPhone. It feels great in the hand. The screen gets significantly brighter than the iPhone outside (2600 vs 2000 nits). And these days, Samsung’s software is very unobtrusive. I didn’t even bother reaching for a custom launcher. It Was Fine! What the whole thing has shown me more than anything is that computing freedom requires that you don't put all your eggs in one basket. That’s how you get stuck with a bunch of rotten eggs, if the basket suddenly falls apart. And Apple has been falling apart for me in terms of trustworthiness, stewardship, and just overall likability over the past few years. Is Google some perfect alternative? Absolutely not! But I’m not switching from Apple to Google as much as I’m switching from Apple to a constellation of strong but distinct alternatives. Samsung, Meta, Google, Amazon. A little from here, a little from there. Tech is better when power is distributed between multiple, competing companies. Living under the absolute rule of a single king is absolutely awful.

But even on the laptop side, there’s plenty to like about the alternatives. Framework has a super novel approach to repairability and upgrades. You can easily swap out any component by yourself, often without tools. Anyone who went through multiple rounds of keyboard replacements with their MacBooks in the horror days of the butterfly keyboard can appreciate how helpful that might be. Even more impressive, though, is that you can So there’s a lot to like in Windows land these days. The M-chip shock dominance has subsided, and even if there’s still an advantage on the laptop side, it’s much less than it has been. That surprised me. But it’s surprised me even more how well Microsoft has managed to integrate Linux with Windows. I thought for sure there’d be a performance penalty to running under WSL. Or that it would be clunky and kludgy. But it just wasn’t. VSCode is part of the trick here. It ships out of the box with an excellent WSL integration where all the files actually live inside the Linux subsystem, so there’s none of that old cross-the-filesystem-chasm slowdown that I remember from my last go-around with Windows. Literally all you have to do is open Powershell, type “wsl --install”, pick your username/password, and you’ll have Ubuntu 22.04 running. Then install VSCode, which auto-detects that WSL is installed, and voila, you can type “code .” in the Ubuntu terminal to open any directory in VSCode on the Windows side. Now that’s slick! After seeing all this in action, and living with it for a week, I seriously contemplating switching daily desktop driver. But I ultimately didn’t. And the reason is that I’m simply just not willing (yet?) to give up And that’s really exciting! That the Mac finally has a no-apologies-needed alternative for people who work with the web and need solid unix underpinnings to get the job done. Apple desperately needs the competition for the mindshare of web developers. Oh, and did I mention you can actually play AAA games on the PC? That $2,349 Dell ships with an NVIDIA 4070, which is plenty of power to drive everything from Fortnite to Cyberpunk 2077. Games that simply just doesn’t exist on the Mac, and maybe never will. It’s wild how we’ve come full circle. Microsoft was the top villain of the late 1990s for everyone I knew in tech, and Apple was the underdog darling. Now it’s the other way around. Switching to OSX in 2001 felt like the rebel move. Now daring to run Windows in 2024 would make you the odd one out in a lot of communities. I for one hope to see a bunch of Windows machines, maybe even Framework laptops, at tech conferences going forward. I’m also keeping both of these PCs at the house. And who knows, if someone eventually ports a color-perfect version of TextMate’s So kudos to Microsoft! By burying the hatchet with Linux, and open source in general, you've arrived at an incredibly productive combination of tools for developers like me.

Creativity is perishable, just like inspiration. It has to be discharged regularly or it will spoil. And if you let enough of it go to waste, eventually your talents will sour and shrivel with it. This was counterintuitive to me. I naively thought I could run out the clock every day on a creatively dead-end job, and then pursue my all own endeavors full of zest at night, with all the creativity I had saved. But it didn’t work like that. Spending eight hours a day spinning my intellectual wheels would get me nowhere at night when I finally tried to move. That’s how I realized that being fully engaged at work is how you plant the best seeds for your own adventures. So when weighing the pros and cons of a given job, you ought to think carefully about whether you’re cultivating those seeds, and tending to their long-term value for your career and your spirit. Nothing spoils them both like a bullshit job. I fully appreciate that not everyone gets to do their favorite things all the time at work. And some times you’re assigned a particularly arid plot to turn. But it’s exactly then you must realize that at least half the creative equation is completely under your control. That you can will the way to rain, if you chose to sieve reality through a new perspective. I like to imagine this sieve as one of those corny self-help tapes: I will make the most of my time here. I will find the sharp creative angle on even the most blunt, boring problem. I will exercise all of my intellectual capacity today in service of raising my talents for tomorrow. I’ve seen that A/B test run time and again over the past twenty years with employees. The ones who are able to judo seemingly boring problems into interesting pursuits always end ahead on creativity and competence, and have more of it left over at the end of the day. And a few years later, the person who discharged all their creativity against even the most trivial problems has grown their intellectual granary manyfold over the one who kept holding back.

It’s a business book for people who don’t have the patience to read a handful of ideas stretched to fit 300 pages. The kind of book that Jason and I would have loved to read, if somebody else had written it. Although it wasn’t as much written as it was edited. Much to the shock and initial resistance of the publisher, we literally cut the manuscript in half in the last round of editing. We didn’t just kill our darlings, we went on a murder spree. What was left was an incredible dense tome of the very best lessons we’d accumulated over many years, told in plain English. No jargon, no filler, no bullshit. That’s why the book has drawings for every essay! The publisher didn’t feel they could charge full price for a book that didn’t look as fat as other business books. But we refused to pad the material itself, so we did what every clever kid faced with an imposed page count has done a million times before us: We increased the font size, we shrunk the margins, and we bumped the line spacing. Oh, and we added a picture for every essay. That made the book look like every other 300-page business book. But the essays themselves are so short, so punchy, that I’ll quote one of my favorites here in full. It’s called ASAP is Poison: Stop saying ASAP. We get it. It’s implied. Everyone wants things done as soon as they can be done. When you turn into one of these people who adds ASAP to the end of every request, you’re saying everything is high priority. And when everything is high priority, nothing is. (Funny how everything is a top priority until you actually have to prioritize things.) ASAP is inflationary. It devalues any request that doesn’t say ASAP. Before you know it, the only way to get anything done is by putting the ASAP sticker on it. Most things just don’t warrant that kind of hysteria. If a task doesn’t get done this very instant, nobody is going to die. Nobody’s going to lose their job. It won’t cost the company a ton of money. What it will do is create artificial stress, which leads to burnout and worse. So reserve your use of emergency language for true emergencies. The kind where there are direct, measurable consequences to inaction. For everything else, chill out. Timeless and succinct. I yearn to hit that brevity today! But I think that’s part of why this collection of mostly twenty-year old lessons continue to sell in such great numbers. REWORK was and is an antidote to the poison of not only ASAP, but business as usual. An uppercut to pompous MBA heads droning on and on about “synergies” or some shit like that.

They need to be computer good. That is, virtually perfect. That’s a tough bar to scale. Let’s take the cars for a minute. Every single year, tens of thousands of people are killed in car accidents in the US. In 2022, it was 42,795 to be exact. The self-driving car argument is that if you could even improve that by 25%, you’d be saving 10,000 lives. That sounds incredible! But it’s also the kind of effective-altruism math that just doesn’t fly in Because let’s just say you’re Tesla. And suddenly half of everyone in America is being driven by one of your robo-cars. Your self-driving tech is highly advanced. 50% better than humans! That leaves you responsible for 10,000 deaths per year. Eeks! Okay, let’s say you’re another order of magnitude better, that’s still 1,000 deaths. Two orders? 100 deaths. Per year. The math is easy, the human element is hard, and the legal ramifications perhaps impossible. The medical angle is even more sticky. I have no doubt that AI will quickly be better at diagnosing most diseases than your average primary physician. Maybe it already is. But that’s still going to mean a lot of misdiagnosis, because human doctors get it wrong all the time. Malpractice lawsuits are one of the key contributors to healthcare costs through insurance rates and settlement figures. How many misdiagnosed patients could Healthcare AI handle before the malpractice lawsuits sink the business? A dozen? A hundred? Which gets us to the lowest level of criticality out of these three examples: Customer service. We played around with a few systems in this space at 37signals, and it was kinda awesome to see the AI handle even hard cases with aplomb in many instances. But it also got a bunch of answers wrong. Sometimes really wrong. What’s a tolerable error rate for having a robot tell your customers some nonsense about your product? That might make them upset enough to tell another 10 people never to try your product again? I don’t know! But it’s probably not 5%. Maybe it’s not even 1%. Maybe the customer service robot actually has to get to 0.01% error rate before it’ll beat a human that gets it wrong 100x more often (1%) before the psychology of the equation works. I find that fascinating. That we humans can look at two situations where answer A is clearly better than answer B on a litany of objective measures, and then we’ll still go with B, because it’s Maybe this is just a phase. Maybe once AI is adopted widely enough, we’ll learn to love our robot helpers, and we’ll start showing them some semblance of the sympathy we would their human counterparts. But also, maybe not. Maybe fallible humans have an inherent advantage over AI by being forgivable? We’ll see.", "date": "2024-02-05T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

It was built to solve our own problems running client projects as an agency where we found email alone to be lacking. The first version was really just the basics: Messages, todo lists, milestones. We didn’t even have file uploads! But it was easy, it was affordable, and it quickly became a success. Mainly because it simply solved a real problem right away. Anyone who’ve tried to organize a larger project over email can instantly recognize how Basecamp cures the pain of keeping everyone in the loop, ensuring things didn’t fall through the cracks, and having a record of decisions for later. That problem is still the same today, which is why Basecamp continues to thrive. Using the same core recipe, two decades after its initial release. That kind of longevity is rare on the internet. It’s even more rare amongst independent software makers. Over time, most companies either stumble, get acquired, or see their core problem solved through other means. That may well happen to Basecamp one day too, but that day is not today. In fact, Basecamp is more relevant than ever. Technological progress has brought many blessings, but boy has it also brought new hassles. Too many companies now live a split-brain existence with data and collaboration scattered over half a dozen tools. All SaaS, all asking a monthly fee. The confusion around what goes where and how to find it is immense. Joan Westenberg captured this predicament of “modern work” perfectly the other day: In contrast, Basecamp puts everything in one place. Bringing some much-needed calm to the daily life of millions of people who are just trying to get stuff done. That simplicity sadly seems like somewhat of a secret cheat code these days. But it’s how we’ve been working for twenty years. Using Basecamp to build Basecamp. Using Basecamp to build HEY, ONCE, Ruby on Rails, Hotwire, and a million other commercial and open source projects. With a comparably tiny team, which, thanks to Basecamp, see extraordinary productivity through asynchronous collaboration and long stretches of uninterrupted time. That’s how we’ve built this brand. By out-sharing and out-teaching the competition. We’re never going to have hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital to light on fire with targeted ads or a huge sales force. But we damn well have the energy, the enthusiasm, and, most importantly, the stamina to keep teaching you the interesting lessons we learn along our way. If you don’t need Basecamp yourself, you can also bring a gift of recommendation. Help someone stuck either just on email or drowning in the modern mess of a million overlapping tools find calm with Basecamp. They'll thank you quickly! Either way, we're here to stay. Basecamp is the kind of ever-green product that solves a perpetual problem, which will be needed as long as humans need to collaborate with each other. Maybe in another 20 years, the interface is all AI-driven and ski-mask accessed, but I'm pretty sure you'll still be saying \"it's in Basecamp\".", "date": "2024-02-05T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Or you can buy a cloud VM from Hetzner with 2 CPUs/4GB of RAM for ~$5/month. That system is good enough to run at least 500 concurrent users. Something that would cost you a staggering $7,500/month, if you were using Slack on their monthly Business+ plan. Just look at that 3-year total cost of ownership. Campfire running on Hetzner would cost you $479 for 500 users over three years ($299 + 36 * $5). Slack with the same number of seats would cost you $270,000!!!

You’re not going to unseat Slack being 10% cheaper. But 99.9% cheaper? Yeah, that might get people’s attention! Of course you’re getting “more” with an enterprise product like Slack. There’s screen after screen of enterprisey settings. And maybe you need that. Maybe that’s worth 1000x more to you. Totally fine if it is.

And now the EEOC, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, has delivered unequivocal clarification that doing any form of preferential hiring on the basis of race (or sex or other protected classes) is (still!) flat-out illegal. The latter came in a remarkable exchange on X between Mark Cuban, who’d taken to defend letting DEI considerations be “part of the [hiring] equation”, and Andrea R. Lucas, a sitting EEOC Commissioner: It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. And directly addresses Cuban’s admission of using race and sex as “part of the equation”: ...an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice. Which is all really very sensible! You can’t hire people on the basis of race, not even if that consideration is only “part of the equation”. That’s exactly as it should be. But it’s also in direct opposition to the DEI mantra of yesterday. That companies needed to explicitly consider race in their hiring practice in order to correct for “historical inequities”. That is, as anti-racism proudly claims, to address past discrimination, we have to discriminate today. In order to ensure that demographic distributions at the national level are mirrored within every corporate environment. The infamous quote from Kendi goes: The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination. These aspirations are not compatible. You can’t both follow the law, and not consider race in your hiring decisions, while somehow actively correcting for real or perceived disparities in the racial makeup of a company during that same process. What you’re allowed to do, of course, is things like the Rooney Rule. Where you seek to broaden the pool of applicants through targeted outreach. But when it comes down to hiring candidate A or B, it’s illegal to let race enter the equation. None of this is new, of course. The Civil Rights Act is from 1964. It was passed to address the explicit and discriminatory use of race in hiring practices. Not to apply discrimination in the opposite direction to get desirable statistical outcomes. But during 2020-2022, this colorblind principle was sacrificed on the new altar of “antiracist discrimination”. The results were startling. In 2021, the S&P; 100 – the cream of Corporate America – added 300,000 jobs. 94% of these positions went to people of color, 6% to white applicants. This was antiracism in action. And, according to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, plainly illegal. I think we’ll see a flood of lawsuits trying to capitalize on this documented pattern of illegal hiring practices soon. The Supreme Court has set the tone in the case of academia, and the EEOC has been clear that “discrimination on the basis of race is illegal”, which of course makes “antiracist discrimination” illegal too. So the legal path has clearly been paved. Especially when employers, like Mark Cuban, go on the record with their illegal “part of the equation” hiring practices. With corporate DEI bureaucracies getting dismantled, I think it’ll be corporate legal departments who drive the agenda for hiring practices going forward. And rule number #1 has gotta be: Don't discriminate on the basis of race. Don’t break the law.", "date": "2024-01-30T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

If it’s a computer, it ought to be yours, and you ought to have the right to install whatever software you should so choose. If it’s not a computer, then what is it? A gaming console? An appliance? A toy? There’s a spectrum in those definitions where consumers perhaps wouldn’t expect the right to install software of their own choosing, even if there’s a “computer” somewhere inside it. And I suspect it’s that mental model that animates the Apple Stans on this issue. They want to escape from the freedom of owning a computer. But I think most people, when it comes down to it, believe that their smartphone is indeed a real computer. And that after paying $1,000 for this computer, they should be able to install whatever software they should so choose. Without having to ask Apple or Google for permission. That they should be able to have a direct relationship with companies like Adobe or Epic or Netflix or 37signals, which isn’t intermediated by some toll-booth operator telling them what’s allowed or asking for an outrageous cut. Just like they’ve been able to do with every modern personal computer since the dawn of computing. Mac developers are rightfully worried that this golden era of computing is coming to an end, though. That Apple is signalling a future where every piece of software that runs on computers has to be approved by app store bureaucrats, busy protecting the business model of the platform. And I think they’re right to worry about this, so now is the time to enshrine this right to compute. While people still remember what it’s like to be free to install software of their own choice. The irony here is that Apple has the best argument for why that freedom is perfectly compatible with a safe computing platform: The Mac. It’s has been an incredibly stable and secure platform for over twenty years now. Ever since it adopted Unix underpinnings, it’s had a fundamental solid reputation for being a safe, mainstream computing platform. Apple promotes it as such all the time! Their ads aren’t cast with computer geeks and science nerds who have to constantly battle the forces of darkness on malware or scams. No, they’re full of regular people doing word processing, photo editing, movie watching, and project management. On their computer! Using software they would have installed from the internet! That’s the fundamental paradox of Apple’s situation. In order to advance their scarecrow case for an iPhone you can install your own software on, they have to sully the reputation of their other computing platform.

Folks who perhaps didn’t think Apple would be “that kind of company”. That they wouldn't so blatantly threaten developers into compliance with such overtly onerous and punitive terms. But they did. And now they’re doubling down. At first glance, it could seem like Apple actually attempted some semblance of good faith compliance with the Digital Markets Act that goes into effect March 7 in the EU. But once you start peeling the onion, you realize it’s stuffed with poison pills so toxic you can scarcely believe Apple’s chutzpah. Let’s start with the extortion regime that’ll befell any large developer who might be tempted to try hosting their app in one of these new alternative app stores that the EU forced Apple to allow. And let’s take Meta as a good example. Their Instagram app alone is used by over 300 million people in Europe. Let’s just say for easy math there’s 250 million of those in the EU. In order to distribute Instagram on, say, a new Microsoft iOS App Store, Meta would have to pay Apple $11,277,174 PER MONTH(!!!) as a “Core Technology Fee”. That’s $135 MILLION DOLLARS per year. Just for the privilege of putting Instagram into a competing store. No fee if they stay in Apple’s App Store exclusively. Holy shakedown, batman! That might be the most blatant extortion attempt ever committed to public policy by any technology company ever. And Meta has many successful apps! WhatsApp is even more popular in Europe than Instagram, so that’s another $135M+/year. Then they gotta pay for the Facebook app too. There’s the Messenger app. You add a hundred million here and a hundred million there, and suddenly you’re talking about real money! Even for a big corporation like Meta, it would be an insane expense to offer all their apps in these new alternative app stores. Which, of course, is the entire point. Apple doesn’t want Meta, or anyone, to actually use these alternative app stores. They want everything to stay exactly as it is, so they can continue with the rake undisturbed. This poison pill is therefore explicitly designed to ensure that no second-party app store ever takes off. Without any of the big apps, there will be no draw, and there'll be no stores. All of the EU’s efforts to create competition in the digital markets will be for nothing. And Apple gets to send a clear signal: If you interrupt our toll-booth operation, we’ll make you regret it, and we’ll make you pay.

Adam Smith captured this perfectly in OG economist text, the tech layoffs continue, there’s naturally a search for someone to blame. People are losing their jobs after all, so that must mean someone is acting malevolent, dammit. This is when the age old accusation of greed is trotted out. Companies are only laying off people now because they’re greedy! If only we could eradicate greed, everyone would still have a job, and all would by dandy. Oh please.The idea that greed is this seasonal affliction that only seem to infect companies and executives occasionally is not a good explanation for these layoffs or, well, anything at all. It’s a cope, as the kids would call it. The beauty, if you will, of the capitalist system is that it produces progress and wealth without relying on benevolence or bleeding hearts. Adam Smith captured this perfectly in OG economist text, The Wealth of Nations from 1776:It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. In the grand scheme of coordination between strangers and acquaintances, most everyone, save for a few saints, has themselves and their families closest. That is, they’re optimizing for their own interests, which is easily mistaken for greed, but is in fact the method that produces our dinner, as Smith would have it. That’s not to say layoffs are “good” or “fair” or any of the other just-world fallacy term one might seek to apply. Layoffs suck. Most for the people laid off, but certainly also for the companies paying severance, incurring public ill will, and missing their financial projections. That’s why greed is such a poor explanation for what’s going on. The most greedy executive would have been shrewd enough to foresee all this, never hired too many people in the first place, and booked all the savings from not having to pay out severance as profits. I think a much better explanation is that nobody knows what the hell is going to happen tomorrow during times of turmoil. And lord have we had turmoil lately. Economists can’t predict whether rates are going up or down, whether people want to buy homes or luxury watches, or even if we’re heading for a recession, a ceasefire, or what the weather in California will be in 2024. NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING! While that’s a good explanation for choices that turn out poorly, it’s a terrible coping mechanism for grieving layoffs. Because it accepts the humanity of everyone involved. That nobody, not you, not highly-paid executives, not stock analysts, have a perfect crystal ball to predict tomorrow. And that no matter how much money you pay a professional CEO, they’ll make bad bets, like hiring too many people in anticipation of growth extrapolations based on yesterday’s weather. At large scales of coordination, greed is a constant. It doesn’t wax or wane, and it absolutely does not sleep. But it’s also the drive of aggregate progress, even if impervious to individual hardship, and remains the key human leverage for the betterment of all.

The original web-based chat system we built back in 2006 is brought back to the future as installable software you only need to buy once. You'll find the entire rationale for why we're excited about this retro concept of installable server software on once.com, but let me give you the short spiel. SaaS has been ruling the world of web-based software for two decades now, and made a lot of people wealthy in the process. For good reason, SaaS is great for systems that need to be services. But there's also a lot of SaaS that does not need to be a service. That could just as well be a simple product. That's the category we've set our bull's eye on with Campfire. Dead-simple chat. Without all the endless configuration screens, without all the enterprisey compromises. Just the basics, done really well. And we're going to sell this system for a one-time price of $299. That's right, for some organizations, they may well be able to save two or three or four orders of magnitude on their chat-system bill by hosting Campfire themselves. And included in that price is free bug and security fixes for at least three years. And you get all the source code to audit and study. We think that's a pretty good deal! Now, the flip side of this is of course that there'll be some folks that just need some of those complicated, complex features of enterprisey chat setups. Campfire won't be for everyone in all circumstances. But that's fine. With a price this low, you can easily afford to run Campfire as a second system. If you really need to control your data or just want a backup. So let's talk about data control. It's something I'm really excited about with Campfire. YOU OWN IT ALL! All your data, both the messages and the file uploads, live on YOUR server. We never see any of it. We don't have any user metrics reporting back to our server (although we do collect crash reports, but you can opt out of that too!). This makes Campfire suitable for even the most stringent GDPR or security requirements. You could install this in any European country, work with the data of children or patients. Fully locked down, as you see fit. Secondly, we've gone all-in on mobile web apps (PWA) for use on phones and tablets. This means routing around the damage Apple and Google are causing app makers and consumers with their draconian app store bureaucracies. And it means we don't have to add 30% on top of the price either. Campfire's mobile web apps use the latest PWA technology, so you get push notifications, badge counts, and all that good stuff people expect from native applications. As I've said before, it's not quite as polished an experience in all regards, but for something like chat, it's more than good enough. But enough talk. Go have a look at Jason's product demo video to get a feel for whether Campfire might work for you. Then checkout my installation video, if you're curious how you'd get up and running. If all of that has piqued your interest, signup to be notified for the full release coming shortly at once.com.

A basket case of a company, with an irrelevant, shrinking marketshare, in dire need of a lifeline. So in 1997, In Redmond, they were still bent on total domination. At the height of its monopoly power over the internet, Microsoft had an incredible 94% marketshare. It used this marketshare to seriously slow down the evolution of the internet, as it continued to perceive it as a threat to the Windows and Office cash cows. And it worked. They really did But Microsoft’s brutish tactics also managed to turn an entire generation of developers against them. And the bill for that didn’t come due until Windows Phone. Nobody, and I mean nobody, wanted to lift a finger to help Microsoft gain a foothold in mobile. The wounds from the late 90s and early 2000s were still fresh in many developers minds. So many cheered as Apple went from underdog, favored by developers for their embrace of Unix roots in their operating system, to the dominant player on a new platform. Microsoft has had to work hard to undo that poisoned relationship ever since, and under Satya Nadella, seems to have broadly succeeded in that mission.

Because it sure as hell isn’t easy, once you get to scale. Part of the original cloud pitch was that it would *become*easy, but[that never panned out](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0). There’s no major web-based information system with millions of users that’s “easy” to run. Most of them have serious operations teams constantly tending to these complex beasts, most of which is around data storage and access.That’s what’s so alluring about single-tenancy, sqlite, and turning services back into products. The possibility of sidestepping much of this complexity for both development and operations. Not that this is anything new, mind you. Our beloved industry consists of a handful of pendulums that continuously swing back and forth, and distributed clients vs centralized services is one of the biggest. But rather than use that historical fact to poo-poo this idea, or any other pendulum swing, you could appreciate the fact that progress usually requires revisiting your priors. I for one am terribly excited about what conceptual compressions might lie just around the corner, if single-tenancy at scale pans out as a strategy.

It took years to recover from that, and brought some rough years for anyone trying to break into or stay in the industry. The bust reached all the way to Copenhagen. I was working for a venture-backed software company in 2001, and with the writing of the dot-com implosion on the wall, I applied to Copenhagen Business School for refuge. But I stayed on as a consultant for a bit longer with the company, so I got to watch the layoffs roll through. It really wasn’t pretty. Eventually the company folded. Getting fired sucks. Whether it’s a mass layoff or individually. I was fired a couple of times before becoming a business owner, and I still remember vivid details from each incident. But I’ve also had to fire several people working for me in the past twenty years, and that’s no picnic either. There are no good firings, just degrees of awful ones. That doesn’t mean it isn’t warranted. Either because the business realizes that it has hired too many people, and gotten ahead of the sales needed to support it. Or because it’s hired the wrong people, and that if it doesn’t let them go, it’s going to hurt the rest of the organization. This is a natural cycle of commerce, and as painful as it seems in the moment, the alternative is usually far worse. I remember talking to an owner of a series of car dealerships in Spain in 2011-2012. The business had seen some massive boom years prior to the Great Recession, but following that, sales had collapsed. So now he had hundreds of employees on the payroll milling around doing very little at all. He could see the demise of the business ahead, but he just couldn’t correct the size of the business fast enough under Spanish law to make the numbers work. And sure enough, a year or two later, the company went belly up, and everyone lost their jobs. Contrast that to Denmark, which has a very flexible labor market. It’s relatively easy to lay off people, which makes companies less afraid of hiring when the going is good. There’s also a decent safety net for people to collect unemployment for a while, which takes some of the sting out of it (even if Danish authorities are extremely pushy to get those on benefits to take a job, any job, to get off it!). I think the Danes have correctly realized that however much it sucks when companies lay off workers, you can’t magically fix that without consequences that are even worse. Whether it’s to make companies really reticent to hire full-time workers or it is to doom companies that could have survived if adjustments were possible. It’s the difference between what we wish was true (nobody ever has to get fired!) and what reality demands (sometimes firings are necessary). Either way, if history is any guide, this forest fire of layoffs that seems to continue this year in tech may just seed the ground for the next big leap forward. Let's hope so!", "date": "2024-01-12T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

We’ve been preparing for our own departure from AWS S3 at The change is effective immediately: 37signals, and the price for taking our data elsewhere is in the crazy-land region of $300,000-$400,000! So imagine my surprise seeing the announcement that Google is doing away with the extortionate egress fee entirely for GCP. The change is effective immediately: Starting today, Google Cloud customers who wish to stop using Google Cloud and migrate their data to another cloud provider and/or on premises, can take advantage of free network data transfer to migrate their data out of Google Cloud. This applies to all customers globally. But as shocking as the fact that Google is dropping the egress racket is, I'm almost more stunned to see them recognizing its benefit for those leaving the cloud in addition to those moving between competitors. I wouldn’t have guessed that the cloud exit discourse, which only really gained steam in 2023, would already be influencing one of the three major hyperscalers! Now I don’t know how many people will actually buy the idea that Google is just doing this out of the goodness of their heart. I have two other theories: - The European Union has been looking at cloud egress fees as an anti-competitive practice, which they may well seek to regulate to improve competition in public clouds. Given how much other anti-trust scrutiny that Google is under, it makes sense for them to get ahead of regulations for once. Especially if it helps deflect attention from their search or ad monopolies. - Google is a distant third in the cloud wars, and they stand to gain far more from goading competitors into following suit than they’ll lose on their end. For Google to win more cloud business, they probably realize they have to start stealing marketshare from Azure and AWS, and that’s just hard to do if egress fees spoil the pitches. But who cares! I commend Google for doing this, regardless of whatever ulterior motives or self-interest is guiding it. Cutting the egress racket absolutely will improve competition in the cloud and make it easier for companies to leave it entirely. That’s good.

We’ve spent a whole year getting the HEY Calendar ready. Millions of dollars in investment. And, as sad as it sounds, it all hinges on Apple. About 85% of paying customers for HEY use Macs and iPhones, so if Apple denied us the ability to distribute our app, we’d be dead. That was the same existential dilemma we faced back in 2020 as well. Tons of businesses, including ours, simply aren't viable if Apple cuts off the air supply that is access to the pocket computers most popular with people who pay for software. With stakes this high, it’s no surprise that scarcely anyone dares to fight them. Most, wisely, just lower their head, stay quiet, and grit their teeth. But that was never our way. This is one of the benefits of being a fully independent company. Jason and I can choose to stand on principle, even if it comes at great risk to the business. There’s no board, no MBAs, no venture capitalists in the background running the cost-benefit analysis. Just two looney tunes on banjo and bass who love making great software. But while those wheels of justice are turning slowly, ours are spinning at full speed. We’re in the final stretch of rolling out the HEY Calendar to all HEY customers this week. We just let in thousands of additional, eager folks to the system. It’s so fun to hear their feedback and the love for what our team has built. Rethinking calendars has been just as rewarding as rethinking email. And look, we were never seriously going to give Gmail or iCloud a run for their marketshare. We have many tens of thousands of customers, but they have hundreds of millions. All we’re asking is to be allowed to sell the niche product that is a paid email and calendar system to people who really care. The majority of folks on earth don’t fall into that category, and will just use whatever comes with their iPhone or deal with the ads and privacy issues on Gmail. But in 2024, HEY has never been better. It even works with people’s existing Gmail accounts now. It’s got all the innovative features we launched with PLUS all the table-stake features we filled in over the past few years. And now we’ve tackled the biggest blocker for adoption: An integrated calendar. So happy everyone with an iPhone can now enjoy it too. Oh, and thanks to everyone who cheered us along the way. There’ll always be a legion of Apple fans to defend every abusive tactic the company employs, but there absolutely is also a huge tribe of developers who recognize monopoly bullshit when they see it. The loud, impressive support from this group really helped us push through this second round of nonsense. Now let’s get on with 2024. Once we’ve finished the full release of the HEY Calendar this week, we’ll be focused on routing around all this app store nonsense with our new ONCE series of products that we’ve bet exclusively on PWA technology with.

I’m not going to rehash the pandemic, Trump, wokeness, social media, or any of the many other perceived or real causes. I’m just going to remark that it’s been weird. But not universally weird. Not hippie weird, for example. Not dreaming broadly of a better world, singing songs, smoking mild pot, and submitting to flower power weird. No, a pessimistic weird. An everything-sucks-all-the-time-and-there’s-nothing-to-do-about-it weird. A depressing, nihilistic, no-end-in-sight weird.

I’m not sure what to think of e/acc or any of the other branded versions of this optimism, but I do think they're seeping into the groundwater, and we’re seeing sprouts everywhere with brighter, greener hues of positivity. I like it. And I especially like it because it feels like I spent a fair amount of my own time in earlier years stuck in that pessimistic rut. This alternative is just better. And now, like a former smoker, these heavy clouds of endless pessimism just seem extra suffocating. In the most existential sort of way: Snuffing out the hope we need to carry forward.

It’s not easy to do anything that well, and we have a seriously skilled and dedicated ops team that deserve huge kudos for making this happen. But, it’s also not rocket science! The magic of Basecamp 2’s incredible two-year 100% uptime, as well as all the other applications hitting 99.99%, come in part from picking boring, basic technologies. We run on F5s, Linux, KVM, Docker, MySQL, Redis, Elastic Search, and of course [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). There’s nothing fancy about our stack, and very little complexity either. We don’t need people with PhDs in Kubernetes or specialists in exotic data stores. And neither do you, most likely.But programmers are attracted to complexity like moths to a flame. The more convoluted the systems diagram, the greater the intellectual masturbation. Our commitment to resisting that is the key ingredient in this uptime success. Now I’m not talking about what it takes to run Netflix or Google or Amazon. At that kind of scale, you hit truly pioneer-level problems to which there are no tried-and-true solutions to pull from. But for the other 99.99% of us? It’s a siren song to model our infrastructure in their image. You don’t need the cloud to get good uptimes. You need mature technologies run on redundant hardware with good backups. Same as it ever was.", "date": "2024-01-07T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

The freedom to make our own choices, good or bad, But after turning the world of software upside down in it’s glory run from 1994 (launch of Netscape) to 2008 (launch of the Apple App Store), the web has had a much harder time in the 2010s and early 2020s. At least for developers. As the most important computers for most people migrated from the desk to the pocket, life for many software makers regressed. Suddenly, you simply had to develop for the walled gardens of Apple and Google to be competitive. Just having a web application was no longer enough for most. That’s not to say that the explosion in pocket computers hasn’t had its benefits too. Of course it has. The market for software is much larger than it was, at least on the consumer side of things. And these glass rectangles are incredible feats of engineering. You can’t love computers and not be impressed. But in terms of the freedom afforded developers and software companies, it’s undoubtedly a regression compared to the web. The most risky part of running a software business is no longer just in making something people want, but Maybe that wouldn’t have tasted so bitter if that was the only world you knew. Apple is keen to promote how much more benevolent a ruler they are than the telcos of old. But comparing the kindness of kings is myopic in contrast to the distinction between free markets and even the fairest sovereign. That’s what we’ve lost: The free market. The mechanism where software makers will sink or float squarely on account of whether independent actors choose to buy or not. And we’ve had that replaced by an erratic majesty operating as they would before Magna Carta. The rules of commerce aren’t even rules, they’re “guidelines”, and they’re as vague as they are shifty. A fig leaf covering absolute power, wielded with absolute impunity. But I like my iPhone, you cry! Yeah, me too. But do you hold your ability to pick the software it runs in such low regard that you’re scared of doing so without a master like Apple telling you what’s permissible? Imagine if your access to the Internet was governed by the same principle. If you could only visit sites pre-approved by AOL or Yahoo? Only buy from online stores that paid a percentage to Verizon or AT&T;? It would be intolerable because you’ve had a chance to taste the fruits of the free web. In all its messy, chaotic glory. Very few people would actually want to give that up in favor of some curated AOL-like walled garden. But when it comes to our pocket computers, most people have never known or imagined life outside the compound. So they’re easily frightened by stories of bandits and scoundrels. Easily intimidated by the uncertainty of change. I get it. That’s human nature. This is why reminding people of what freedom feels like on the web or with their personal computer is so important. We do have parallels. We have seen the value of open markets. We’ve had faith in our own ability to decide whether to buy, install, visit or not. But it’s hard for people to imagine what they don’t have. Hard to mourn all the innovative applications that don’t exist because the business model wouldn’t work with a 30% tax. Hard to sympathize with all the entrepreneurs who gave up on making apps because it was just too frustrating to deal with the app store bureaucracies. That’s just reality. We have to accept that, and then have we to find a way to route around the damage. That’s what the internet does so very well. It treats gatekeepers as a bug and finds a way around them. Whether it be censorship or monopolies. So that’s what animates me today. Finding a route around these intolerable restrictions on free software markets. And with I mean, that's a speculative prediction, not a statement of fact. Maybe the fidelity still isn’t actually good enough for most people or the friction around installation is still too high. But we have to try. It’s our best chance yet, baring any real breakthrough on monopoly enforcement in Europe and the US. And I've stopped holding my breath for that. We’re going to try with Not 10/10 good, just yet. Mobile apps still have an easier path to getting that final bit of polish right on touch-based interfaces. The web still betrays its mouse-and-keyboard origins in many places. But we’re getting closer and closer, and I don’t think we’ve even come close to maximizing what’s possible with what we got today. It reminds me of how the first games on a new console generation are always miles off from those at the end of an era. If you compare the first titles for the 32-bit era with the last, it’s night and day. Even though the underlying capabilities of the platform were the same all along. Developers learn the tricks, they compress the complexity, and they raise the bar. We need to do that for PWAs. Really dig in to get the most out of what’s already in the platform today, while continuing to cheer and push for the standards and their implementations to improve. And I know we can do that. Developers have done that since the dawn of computing. Have you seen Let’s get to it. Roll up your sleeves. Help shrink the fidelity gap. Let’s get those delicious native swipes replicated on the web in an easily reusable form. Let’s get all the nice little animations too. We can absolutely do this.

If you’ve managed to overturn a rejection of your service once, they can’t come after you on the same service again later. We could have used that today! But unfortunately there is no rule of law with the app stores, except that of the jungle, and Apple is the 800 lbs gorilla, ruling as it sees fit. So now HEY is back on trial in their kangaroo court. This time with our new calendar feature, HEY Calendar, which we dared make a separate app in service of users. After spending 19 days to review our submission, causing us to miss a long-planned January 2nd launch date, Apple rejected our stand-alone free companion app “because it doesn’t do anything”. That is because users are required to login with an existing account to use the functionality. This is a ridiculous charge. The App Store is filled with high-profile applications that require an existing service account and simply presents a login screen when first launched. Here are just four: Salesforce, JPMorgan, Netflix, and Google Calendar all greet the user with the same gate: Login with your existing account. There are thousands of other apps just like this. Some access enterprise services, like Salesforce. Some access consumer services, like JPMorgan. Some access streaming services, like Netflix. And, finally, some access calendar services that are part of a larger subscription suite you purchase on the web, like Google Calendar. And HEY Calendar! But none of this even matters. Nowhere in the Apple App Store Guidelines is there a prohibition on apps that require preexisting accounts! The only ruleset that’s relevant to this discussion is that which governs who has to use in-app payments and who can avoid it. Those were the rules we fought Apple over when HEY originally launched back in 2020. Where we successfully managed to secure a carve-out. This is that carve-out from 3.1.3 (f): As you can see, Email Services are specifically mentioned because HEY fought this battle once already back in 2020. HEY Calendar is a free companion app to that very same service. It’s even more frustrating because this one-service-many-apps strategy is exactly the same that Apple has taken with iCloud. That’s one subscription which is powered by a suite of individual apps. You have Mail, you have Calendar, you have Files. All connect to the same cloud service that’s billed for once. Just like HEY. But Apple has become so emboldened by a decade of free monopoly reign that they don’t even feign a superficial adherence to their own rules. They carve out exceptions left and right to mega corporations they’d rather not anger, then invent entirely new rules that aren’t codified anywhere when it suits them, and finally rebuts every demand for consistency and predictability with “just submit your app and we’ll review”. This is intolerable. But it’s also highly profitable. Service revenue is the fastest growing part of Apple’s business, and none of that revenue comes easier than taking a 30% cut of the app economy. So what’s going to happen? I don’t know, but I do know that we’ll keep fighting. We’re never going to roll over and pay Apple 30% in protection money to be left alone. Last time we found a way, and we will again. Hopefully our example, and the countless others we’ve seen over the years, will finally force competition authorities around the world to act. We have the Digital Markets Act coming in the EU in just a couple of months. That could very well be a game-changer. So too could the lawsuit by the American Department of Justice that was just revealed to be imminent today. The last time the DOJ sued Microsoft in the late 90s/early 2000s, it inflicted a serious wound on Redmond’s capacity to capture markets, which gave us the rise of Google, Apple, and others. Hopefully that will happen again and a thousand free-market flowers will bloom once no longer deprived of access to sun, water, and customers. One can only dream. But one should also fight.

And for many good reasons. Education is state-funded, and students are even paid a stipend to go to university. Health care is equally free of individual charge, and there’s generally a robust social safety net for unemployment, maternity leave, and the like. Not to mention the fact that Copenhagen is But to pine for a society like the Danish purely on the basis of the benefits is delusional. These benefits are fenced by a myriad of compromises and obligations. The fawning, superficial adoration that American liberals usually bestow on Danish society rarely seems to dwell on these protective factors, so let’s spend a minute doing so. That free education? Yes, it’s great, but it’s also fiercely guarded by meritocratic access. Every in-demand field of study is guarded by the all-important grade-point average from High School. If yours is too low, well, sorry, you’re just not going to study psychology or become a midwife. It doesn’t matter whether you came from an underprivileged background, did a million extracurriculars, or hail from an ethnic minority. You either make the grade for your first choice or you pick something else to study. Almost all of higher education is of course also state run, and on a strict budget. Many American colleges more closely resemble a 4-year luxury vacation than they do the often dreary Danish experience (and I’m not just talking about the lack of sunlight for months in the winter!). Last I looked, I think the Danish government spent something like $13,000 per student per year. The teaching itself is usually fine, but the experience overall is rather barebones compared to what many Americans would imagine (but Danish students do compensate in part by consuming And even with stipends, most Danish students either hold a part-time job or take out student loans or both. I left my three-year degree with about $14,000 in student loans in 2005, which is about $20,000 today, adjusted for inflation, or about the same as Healthcare is also state run, and access is fiercely guarded by financial constraints too. You need a referral for all specialties, the wait may be substantial, and usually when you go to the doctor, you’re treated to a strict 15-minute slot, that’s it. Such efficiency has its price. Just in my immediate family, I’ve witnessed at least three faulty diagnosis, two of which had serious consequences. But much of the time the system is fine, and I’d say for routine stuff, I even prefer the brutal efficiency. Several times while living in Copenhagen from 2020-2023, I’d literally be in and out of the doctor’s office in less than twenty minutes. There’s no paperwork, you just scan your yellow health insurance card, and you never see any of the bills. Nobody has to worry about going bankrupt from becoming seriously ill. But if you’re used to being able to easily select your own doctor, and expect treatment in a few weeks at most, not months, you’d probably be in for a surprise as a consumer of the Danish healthcare system. Everything is run with an eye on the economics, even if the bill isn’t sent to the patient. Perhaps the most shocking example of this to me was the maternity ward in Copenhagen’s prestige hospital, where new mothers are customarily discharged a mere four hours after delivery. That is to say that care is heavily rationed. Doctors usually default to a walk-it-off or wait-and-see diagnosis, and while that’s clearly the only way to constrain costs in a state-run system, it’s certainly not without it’s trade-offs. Any American who’ve been fortunate enough to enjoy a good health insurance package would see this setup as a serious reduction in care. But it is egalitarian. You’ll get the same cancer treatment at the state-run hospitals, broadly speaking, whether you’re a lawyer or a street sweeper. Same too with education where if you put in the work to get good grades, there are no legacy admissions to outrun or donor wheels to grease. That still doesn’t guarantee equal outcomes, of course, but it really is remarkably fair in its equality of opportunity for both treatment and learning. Which brings us perhaps to the biggest bugbear about Denmark that American liberals tend to skate past: Immigration. Denmark is a highly homogenous society. 87% of Danes share the same ethnic heritage, and they openly credit their cohesive culture and willingness to participate in and share for the common welfare to this fact. In the mid-90s, after a decade of doe-eyed optimism about immigration in general and asylum seekers in particular, a powerful nationalistic party set a tone for foreigners in Danish politics that remains to this day. At first the political establishment fought this new force, sought to keep them out of influence, but it didn’t last long, because the renegades represented the will of a large number of Danes who realized the dangers of unrestricted immigration early, and voted accordingly. You can contrast this political reality with Sweden, which otherwise shares a lot of similarities with the Danes in terms of welfare-state design. They went with an open-door policy on immigration for far longer, ended up taking many more (about 3x Denmark), and are now in a world of hurt with This example just across the sea has only emboldened the broad Danish hostility to foreigners. What used to be fringe political demands in the early 90s have long since turned into establishment priorities. Denmark has sought for years to You see, despite the fact that Danes proudly declare themselves to be a social-democratic state, it pursues perceived freeloaders with a savagery worthy of its Viking roots. Anyone deemed to be insufficiently enthusiastic in contributing to the common good, usually through work and by paying taxes, are hunted morally and practically by the culture and the state. The egalitarian ethos only applies to those who contribute and those who conform. And contribute you will. Your tax rate in Denmark starts at around 37%, and by the time you’re making $85,000/year, you’ll be paying above 50% on your marginal earnings. On top of that, you’ll pay a 25% value-added tax on all purchases. All this free education and free healthcare doesn’t come cheap! But while high taxes might not offend the liberal American’s sensibilities, the national conforming measures might. There is no separation between Church and State in Denmark. Denmark is a proudly Protestant nation, has a church minister in the government, and pays to maintain a large network of churches around the country. By default, everyone pays 1% of their income to the Danish church system. Additionally, Danes fund a monarchy headed by one of oldest royal bloodlines in the world. The soon-to-be former Queen can trace her lineage back a thousand years. All the way back to the likes of Harald Bluetooth who introduced Christianity to the Danes in the 9th century. The key figures in the royal family enjoy approval ratings above 80%. So Denmark is steeped in strong national traditions and institutions, and outside of a small cultural elite, looks highly skeptical on the concept of multiculturalism in theory, and actively fights it on almost every corner in practice. To generalize broadly, Danes are content paying high taxes for high services, as long as the recipients look like them, and all do their outmost to pitch in. There’s no tolerance for loafers, not even in high society. It’s a sin to sit idle for too long in Denmark. One area where this is apparent is with working mothers. Denmark has the highest rate of small children in daycare in the world. While new mothers enjoy a generous maternity leave of up to one year, 18% of all Danish children under one years old are already enrolled in daycare. And these new mothers are expected to return to the labor market immediately after their initial leave. It’s perceived as antisocial or low-status to be a stay-at-home mom. Something typically associated with poorly integrated immigrants. It doesn’t matter how well off you are. You had a kid? Awww, that’s great. So when are you getting back to work? Still, if you compare to many working mothers in America, this is of course preferable. Even if there’s no socially-approved path to staying home with the kids past the first year, at least you’ll have several months to bond with your new baby. But again, trade-offs, obligations, and strict cultural expectations apply. Denmark also has zero tolerance for vagrants or drug users. You will not find any of the open-drug scenes that have ravaged American cities like San Francisco. (The tourist attraction of Christiania and it’s “Pusher Street” as the partial exception that proves the rule.) Marijuana remains illegal, drug dealers are caught and prosecuted, and you can get in serious trouble for possession as well. The same goes for the mentally ill. You’re not going to find obviously distressed individuals roaming the streets of Copenhagen for long before they’re picked up by the police. Denmark will involuntarily commit anyone who’s a potential danger to themselves or others, and it really doesn’t take much. Panhandling is also illegal. A Romanian man who begged on the streets of Copenhagen was This might all sound rather harsh, and it definitely can be for anyone who violates the social norms. But the upside is a country that is remarkably safe and inviting to everyone who complies with the shared standards. You see young children everywhere on the streets of Copenhagen, even at night. Our own son started taking the metro alone around the city at age 9! I recall playing outside after dark at age 6 with my friends, and those 1980s freedoms for kids are very much still alive. The point is that the Danes understand that they can’t both have a safe, open society where young children can be out alone at night, take the metro by themselves, and enjoy the play parks by themselves, if they also allow druggies, vagrants, beggars, and the mentally ill to roam the streets on their own accord. A strong civil society relies invariably on strong norms that are judiciously enforced by both customs and cops. The fruits of Danish society are meticulously guarded by a strong, tall fence that surrounds the garden. In Denmark, this is self-evident, and not even up for serious debate. Neither is the fact that when you do all of this in a country with a GDP per capita only 2/3s that of the US, you’re not going to live lavishly in a material sense.", "date": "2024-01-04T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Many appear imbued with fundamental opposition to the idea that how something looks should even matter. That somehow such a focus is conflict with where it ought to be: on substance. This is very apparent in the discussion about linting code. Linting is a term for applying a consistent style to source code. Like following Some languages, like Go, have It reminds me of I can already hear the objection: Code isn’t prose! Its compile target is the computer, not the imagination! Oh do I dare to differ. The best code to me is indeed its own form of poetry, and style is an integral part of such expression. And in no language more so than Ruby. Whereas Python’s motto has long been “there should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it”, Ruby is the exact opposite. There are many ways to do almost everything, and it’s why reading and writing Ruby is such a delight to people like me who Let me give you the most basic example: Linting is a term for applying a consistent style to source code. Like following Strunk & White’s grammatical guidelines for prose, but automatically enforced by a linting program. It’s a technique that’s been around for a long time, but one that’s seen broader adoption with the advent of cloud-based continuous integration setups, which run tests, and now linting, on every pull request prepared.Some languages, like Go, have a built-in linter, which applies a universal style that’s been set by the language designers. That’s the most totalitarian approach. A decree on what a program should look like that’s barely two feet removed from a compile error. I don’t like that one bit.It reminds me of Newspeak, the new INGSOC language from Orwell’s 1984. Not because of any sinister political undertones, but in the pursuit of a minimalist language, with no redundant terms or ambiguities or flair. Imagine every novel written in the same style, Hemingway indistinguishable from Dickens, Tolkien from Rowling. It would be awfully gray to enjoy the English language if there was only a single shade of prose.I can already hear the objection: Code isn’t prose! Its compile target is the computer, not the imagination! Oh do I dare to differ. The best code to me is indeed its own form of poetry, and style is an integral part of such expression. And in no language more so than Ruby. Whereas Python’s motto has long been “there should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it”, Ruby is the exact opposite. There are many ways to do almost everything, and it’s why reading and writing Ruby is such a delight to people like me who strive to write code as an author more often than as an engineer.Let me give you the most basic example: def ensure_privileged_access if !person.admin? redirect_to root_url, end end I’ve always found that “if not” expression to be clumsy, even though it’s a mainstay of most programming languages. But Ruby also allows you to write like this: def ensure_privileged_access redirect_to root_url unless person.admin? end Now I don’t know if I’d call that poetry, but I do find it far more pleasant to read. And that’s just a single sentence. Compose a few of those into a paragraph (method), then into an essay (class), and soon you’ll have a whole book (system). It matters how that's written. There are probably people who would prefer the more conventional, literal style, and they could encode that preference in a lint rule. I’d have absolutely no problem with that, as long as they’re not trying to force me to abide by their stylistic preferences. Which gets to the crux of the question with linters. I think they’re excellent tools for authors and teams to enforce their style with consistency on their codebases. That’s why we’re shipping a default linter, cleverly called RuboCop, in the next version of Rails. Not such that I, or anyone, can mandate what style your codebase ought to be written in, but such that you can find and enforce your own. Not everyone has yet developed a personal or team style, though, and for them, we’re we’re including the preferences I’ve developed during the last two decades, writing hundreds of thousands of lines of Ruby code with the team at 37signals. That’s the omakase menu. But it really is just a starting point for Rails programmers and teams to develop their own sensibilities, not a permanent edict on what those should be. That to me is the essence of style, it’s invariably idiosyncratic. We wouldn’t even be talking about style if it was all the same for everyone all the time. Ruby affords us such rich and expressive syntax that it would be a damn shame if we narrowed all possible paths down to a single, pre-approved trail.

I want to lose 10 lbs, I want to read more books, I want to x, y, and z. Often, it’s just a fantasy. They’re not actually going to lose 10 lbs or they might order some more books but never read them. But at least there’s a spark of hope there. A fundamental faith that they could become a better them. I think that’s tremendously admirable. The trouble with a lot of these aspirations, though, is that they require the formation of new habits and carving out new chunks of time in an already busy day. That’s not impossible, of course, but it’s hard. But the one activity most people already have a huge block of the day carved out is at work. That’s a solid eight hours for the majority of people with a regular job. Forty hours a week. About two thousand a year. Imagine if you spent just 10% of that dedicated to actually getting better at what you do. When I think back over my career, this is where the bulk of the advancement happened. Through a commitment to getting better, smarter, faster at what it is I already spend eight hours a day doing, during that time. For me, that’s mostly programming, writing, marketing, and management. Every single one of those disciplines hold the promise for improved effectiveness through increased competence. So spending a healthy chunk of the day in deliberate practice and refinement seems like an easy investment to justify. So what does that actually look like? Let’s take programming. I write a lot of code that’s just meant to solve some problem or implement some feature. There’s usually a quick way to do that by following the path and patterns I already know. That’s the dividend of experience. You’ve done something before, so you can do it again. But it’s also a potential trap. See, experience will give you a leg up on doing the same things you’ve done before in the same way. But it’ll also raise the price of trying something new, since that might take longer. This is why so many of the big paradigm shifts that happen across disciplines often come from outsiders or even novices. Once you’ve been cooked in experience for too long, the cost of trying something new can seem prohibitive. But spend you must, if you aren’t to stagnate. So with programming, I try to make it a point of frequently taking the longer route. First, I don’t just want the thing I’m working on to merely work. I mean, that’s step one, but we can’t stop there. As the saying goes: make it work, make it right, make it fast. And then, let me add one more: Make it beautiful. This focus on aesthetics is a form a deliberate practice. When the bar isn’t just a completed task but a delightful solution, you’re frequently forced to find novel solutions in the wilderness of unfamiliar techniques. There’s so much learning in there. But it requires you to take a breath, look around, and actively search for the hidden flowers of new competency. It’s the old slow is smooth, smooth is fast again. You take another 15 minutes here, or even 2 hours there, and you don’t just get it right, but you reach two steps further by making it beautiful. (I’m not going to go into a whole dissertation of what is beauty. If you work professionally within any area of competency, you need to develop that eye first. Even if you can’t explain exactly what makes a beautiful piece of code, design, or prose, you ought to be able to recognize it. Without this ability to recognize excellence, you’re never going to be able to get that. But let’s assume you have this basic, junior appreciation already in place.) I find that it’s in this search for aesthetic satisfaction that so many of the best lessons are found. I’m not talking about ornamentation or bells and whistles. I’m taking about the beauty of the four Cs: Clarity, cohesion, consistency, and conciseness. If you have the eye, you’ll recognize them easily (even if getting there isn’t quite so easy). The most practical way I know how to put this principle into action is by reading and rewriting the draft. Everything has a draft, even decisions about management. Step one is not to overthink the initial inspiration. Just get it out of your head and down on paper. Now you have something you can work with, something you can mold. With programming, that’s the pull request. Some people might see that primarily as a tool of collaboration with others, but I see it as a tool of collaboration with myself first. It’s where the complete body of work, across multiple code commits, is stationed before it enters the codebase. It’s the ideal place to study by zooming out so you can see the whole solution and question its proportions. That’s why I’m a If there’s anything I see juniors often miss, it’s this. Careful, repeated, hell, even obsessive, study of their own work. For programmers that means poring over that pull request of theirs over and over again until it’s as aesthetically pleasing as it is functionally correct. To the level of every line break, every new domain word, every expansion of existing classes or methods. “But I don’t have time!”, is what I often hear. Or, even worse, “it doesn’t matter, just ship it!”. But it does matter. Because your career, and even your business, is not a single sprint. It’s an intellectual iron man repeated until you’re in the ground. Whatever time you take to refine your technique now will be paid back to you for the next 20-40-60 years of your career. Getting your posture right early is how you reap those dividends of good form. It’s the same thing with writing. Not just for public consumption, like this, but for internal communication as well. Every comment, every proposal, every bug report is an opportunity to become a little better, a little clearer, and a little more persuasive. But you have to work on it, it doesn’t just happen. I love that loop. Write, revise, write, revise. It’s like doing reps in a gym. You can’t expect that 10 pull-ups will add any discernible new muscle. But 30 pull-ups, across three sets, done thrice a week, for a year? Yeah, you’re going to notice the cumulative results of that. But you have to decide that this matters. The incremental but relentless pursuit of betterment. Taking two beats to get it right, not just getting it working. To slow down, so that you can do it smoothly, so that you can eventually become quicker than you ever imagined. It’s all possible. Work offers endless opportunities and plenty of time. The main blocker is your will to see it so. Try moving that blocker out of the way for 2024. You’ll be amazed what a year can move if you make it count.", "date": "2023-12-22T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

It’s now possible to build fast, modern web applications without transpiling or bundling either JavaScript or CSS. I’ve been working towards this personal nirvana ever since we begrudgingly started transpiling and bundling assets in the late 2000s. Browsers just weren’t good enough back then to avoid it. But they are now. Here’s a chart of the 68 individual JavaScript files that we load in ONCE #1 via import maps. The waterfall is vertical. HTTP/2 ensures we scarcely pay any penalty for sending so many individual files, yet reap huge rewards with fine-grained cache expiration: I know you have to be a real nerd to think this is pretty, but I think this is pretty. Because I know what’s behind it. I know that looking at any of those individual files via View Source reveals exactly the same source code that I see in my editor. It’s been a long time since JavaScript developers and designers could say that. Now it’s possible. And yes, this is now true about CSS as well. Here’s the same chart for our CSS. Individual files, relying exclusively on standardized CSS available in the latest evergreen versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox: And look at what that CSS actually looks like: To people who haven’t seen modern, vanilla CSS, something like this might look like it’s from the future. Nesting?! Variables?! Yes. Yes. It’s good! And if you run this application, and all these many, small individual files, against the test of PageSpeed Insights, you’ll get a perfect 100 on the performance measurement. Our browsers are finally good enough to natively deliver the performance and ergonomics needed. Incredible achievement by the teams at Apple and Google and Firefox: Now, when some JavaScript people see arguments like this, it seems like their brain just turns into a red mush of rage. Like I’ve insulted their religion and all its holy prophets. I don’t quite get it, but let me try to ameliorate it anyway: It’s OK to still use bundlers! I’ve been pretty excited about the progress brought forward with esbuild and bun. I think both projects are really cool, and if you’re working on one of those big, honking SPA apps with hundreds or thousands of NPM dependencies, and megabytes of JavaScript that needs to travel over the wire, you should take full advantage of these powerful tools. All I’m demonstrating here is that it’s no longer necessary to live and work like this. You can choose something different. Hotwire is an alternative. #Nobuild is an alternative. Nobody is taking your favorite bundler away. TypeScript is still there for those who want that. IT’S ALL GOOD! What I’m saying is that I’m just incredibly, over-the-moon pleased with the fact that I don’t need any of that stuff any more. That I can develop entirely against the superb runtime that’s shipped with every browser to handle JavaScript and CSS. I think that’s so cool! I think that’s part of what makes the web so special as a development platform. I don’t even mind having had to travel a long way to get here. I did webpack, I’ve done esbuild, I’ve done all of it along the way. But I’m a firm believer that complexity ought to be a temporary price we pay for progress. The final destination, for me, has always been simplicity.

Perhaps our most productive one yet, in terms of total number of product improvements, new product developments, and open source extractions. But it’s only by looking back at the work from a distance that you can really appreciate it. So allow me to do that here. To appreciate the banner year of programming productivity that was 2023 at our company. Before I get into the actual open source gifts we were able to share this year, though, I think it’s important to remark on the fact that 37signals is not an open-source software company. In the sense that we don’t make money from open source. We don’t sell service, hosting, training, or licenses. None of that stuff. We sell business software. Our main products are the project management tool Basecamp and our email system HEY. And this year we’ve also finished a brand new calendar system that’ll go together with HEY, which will be released shortly, as well as an entirely new product category for us with the ONCE suite, where the first application just went into a private beta release. Alongside an avalanche of product improvements for Basecamp and HEY Email. It’s from these real-world products and services that we extract our open source gifts. We don’t do speculative software development here. All these tools and frameworks have been forged in the fire of real customer usage, pressure, and demands. We build what we need to do what’s required. No more, no less. Here are the five big open source gifts we made this year: Kamal We moved out of the cloud in 2023. Took our three million-dollar cloud budget and more than cut it in half by buying our own hardware and running it ourselves. To do this, we built our own deployment tool on top of Docker called Kamal. It made it easy for us to handle our bare metal boxes with the same ergonomics we’d become accustomed to in the cloud. It’s already spawned a vibrant community of external contributors reaping the simplicity and savings we’ve seen. It's the realization that while Kubernetes and other tools have brought great sophistication and standardization to the world of hyperscalers, there's also a need for simpler offerings with a much (MUCH!) lower learning curve. You shouldn't need a PhD in container orchestration to be able to deploy applications in HEY or Basecamp or even something smaller. Kamal is the result of taking two steps back from the industry standards and say \"do we really need all this?\". It's also a commitment to the idea of open source that doesn't require a service company to work. Our incentive with Kamal was to make something so simple that you wouldn't need a SUSE or whoever to figure it out and be confident in your deploys. Solid Cache The quickest path to a fast application is by judicious caching. That goes for all layers of the stack. You should have a big InnoDB cache for your MySQL database to look up indexes and queues in memory. You should cache your web assets for far-future expiry and use fingerprinting to bust them. And you should cache the server-side rendered HTML fragments that don’t change. That last part is where Solid Cache come in. We’ve been using Redis to cache server-side HTML fragments since forever. The big breakthroughs in that domain came with key-based expiration over a decadeago. The Russian-doll caching approach is still the best way to cache deeply in Rails. But as well as this works, it’s limited by the amount of RAM you have available for caching. So given the fact that modern SSD drives have gotten so incredibly, bonkers fast, we thought storing these fragments on disk rather than in memory would not only be good enough, but far better. Turned out to be true! We are now storing months worth of fragment caches for Basecamp and HEY at a sliver of the cost our old Redis-based system could do. This means faster response times, it means easy encryption of sensitive content, and it means fewer moving parts. Solid Cache plugs right into the Rails caching framework, so it’s essentially a no-config change for the majority of Rails applications out there. Solid Queue Like with caching, we’ve been using a Redis-backed job queueing system for ages at 37signals. It’s called Resque, and over the years it’s grown a million tentacles and hot patches to deal with the demands of processing over a hundred million jobs every day. We had no fewer than 7 different Resque-related gems in our Gemfiles, and still had yearnings for more observability and insight. So we thought: If modern SSDs are good enough for caching, they’re probably also now good enough for queuing. And yes, yes they are. Especially given recent advances in database technology, specifically the SKIP LOCKED syntax available in MySQL 8+ and PostgreSQL 9.5+. That thesis has panned out as well. We’re now running millions of jobs through Solid Queue where they can benefit from ACID transactional guarantees, increased observability, and the fresh breeze of a clean-sheet design based on more than a decade’s worth of hard-won lessons in queuing at scale. We built Solid Queue from the outset with the goal that it could become the new default queuing backend for Rails 8. So even though it works best with MySQL 8+ and PostgreSQL 9.5+ due to their support for SKIP LOCKED, it’ll also work at lower levels of throughput with SQLite. Meaning that all the default Rails databases are accounted for. Rails 8 will no long be BYOQ (Bring-Your-Own-Queue). Jobs will just work out of the box. Nice! Strada Hotwire, our alternative suite of JavaScript frameworks for building modern web applications, has been on an absolute tear in 2023. It seems that a lot of folks finally realized that the future of the web doesn’t have to be built by sending JSON back and forth. You can actually send HTML straight from the server to the browser, sprinkle some Stimulus controllers on a navigation flow powered by Turbo, and end up with amazing applications that use but a tiny sliver of the front-end code assumed necessary today. Strada brought the final piece of that puzzle when it comes to native, mobile applications. It lets you create fully native controls to pair with your hybrid web views. This is how we build the excellent native 4.7+mobileapps for Basecamp and HEY. They have native controls and trim where it counts, and then use server-side rendered HTML for everything else. With Strada, we can now programmatically drive those native elements straight from the HTML that’s created on the server. This means we can release new features on the web that’s instantly available with native controls on the apps, without having to wait for App Store approval. It’s a big win in terms of mobile productivity. Turbo 8 Turbo is the heart of Hotwire. It’s the essence of progressive enhancement. You can drop it into your Rails application (or any other type of server-side framework!), change absolutely nothing, and it’ll feel much faster and smoother. If you need even more, you can level up with Turbo Frames to lazy-load parts of the page or restrict interactions to smaller in-page scopes. And finally, you can control each piece of the DOM over Web Socket (or in response to requests) through Turbo Streams that’ll let you append, update, delete any element straight from the server. It’s marvelous. But as we were developing HEY Calendar, we realized that at the outer edges of fidelity, there was room for one more step. That step is morphing. It’s not a new technique, but it’s been refined recently with the Idiomorph algorithm, which has made it much easier to use with HTML fragments that weren’t designed for morphing (like requiring every element to have an id). The big win is that you get to preserve scroll position and input fields automatically. That’s pretty important on as complicated a UI as a calendar, so having this wrapped in such an easy-to-use form as “redirect to this page, then do a morph” is just perfect. Turbo 8 is the only thing on this list that hasn’t been fully released yet, but there’s a beta available already, so it’s getting close. All this was done by a team of 13 Ruby programmers and 7 native programmers. While they moved Basecamp and HEY big leaps forward. And created the new HEY Calendar and ONCE #1. Collaborating from around the world, working remotely. I’m really proud of that. But it’s also only possible because people who appreciate this work and these gifts help us promote Basecamp and HEY. The millions of dollars we invest every year in open source gifts has to come from paying customers of these products and services. Thankfully, both applications typically sell themselves once someone gives them a try, but we still need folks to hear about them. So a huge thank you to everyone who’ve either bought HEY for themselves or helped a business buy Basecamp. You’re literally enabling all of this. Yes, you! Even if the credit card isn’t coming out of your own wallet, the word of mouth you do to recommend our stuff is absolutely essential. I don’t know if every year is going to be as spectacularly bountiful as 2023 was, but I promise you that we’ll try. There are so many technological advancements in the HEY Calendar and ONCE #1 that I can’t wait for us to extract and share. The new frontiers with PWAs, installable apps, and #nobuild are really exciting. We’ll try our best to continue to push the web forward to a simpler, easier place for new and existing business to build.

We also detailed the larger values, beyond just cost, that was driving our cloud exit. Things like independence and loyalty to the original ethos of the internet. Still in February, we announced the new tool I had bootstrapped in a few weeks to take us out of the cloud – without giving up on all the innovation in containers and operating principles from the cloud. This was the introduction of Kamal. Shortly thereafter, all the hardware we needed for our cloud exit arrived on pallets in our two geographically-dispersed data centers. All 4,000 vCPUs, 7,680GB of RAM, and 384TB of NVMe storage of it! To say this journey was controversial is putting it mildly. Millions of people read the updates on LinkedIn, X, and by following this very mailing list. I got thousands of comments asking for clarification, providing feedback, and expressing incredulity over our nerve to zig when others were still busy catching up to the zag. But the proof was in the pudding. Not only did we complete our cloud exit quickly, customers scarcely noticed anything, and soon the savings started to mount. Already in September, we’d secured a million dollars in savings on the cloud bill. And as the reserved instances (where you prepay for a whole year in advance to get better pricing) started to expire, the bill just kept collapsing: Which brings us till today. The cloud exit is done, but the questions keep coming. Oh do they keep coming. So rather than answer the same points over and over (and OVER!), I thought I’d compile a good old fashioned list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). Here goes: Won’t your hardware savings be swallowed by bigger team payroll? No, because we didn’t change the team composition after our cloud exit. The same people who were operating HEY and Basecamp and the other apps in the cloud are now operating them on our own hardware. This is the central deceit of the cloud marketing, that it’s all going to be so much easier that you hardly need anyone to operate it. I’ve never seen it. Not at 37signals, not from anyone else running large internet applications. The cloud has some advantages, but it’s typically not in a reduced operations headcount. Why didn’t you just optimize your cloud bill instead? Our cloud bill used to be twice as large as the highly optimized, monthly scrutinized, heavily haggled bill we detailed in the $3.2 million for 2022. We had squeezed just about every drop from that lemon, and it was a ton of recurring work to do. That’s part of why I’m so bullish on the concept of cloud exits for mid-sized and above software companies. It’s extremely easy to spend 2-3-4x the amount we were blowing every month on a business with the same number of customers as we have. Which means even higher potential for savings for most. But what if you had written a Cloud Native application instead? Cloud Native, as in opposition to “lift’n’shift”, is often touted as The Real Way to take advantage of the cloud, but that’s again just more cloud marketing nonsense. It generally centers around the erroneous belief that serverless functions, and associated on-demand tooling, is going to make things cheaper. But if you need a pound of sugar, you’re not going to save any money buying single-wrapped cubes. I wrote about that in more detail in Don’t be fooled by serverless and Even Amazon can’t make sense of serverless of microservices. What about security? Aren’t you worried about getting hacked? The majority of security problems you face by operating software on the internet comes from the application and its direct dependencies. The work that needs to happen to properly secure your custom-built application is not any materially different whether you own the computers it runs on or rent them from a cloud provider. If anything, operating services in the cloud can give people a false sense of security. Thinking that it’s not something they have to worry about, when it absolutely is. The big advantage of modern containerized application delivery, though, is that you’re no longer spending much time patching machines manually. Most of it is packaged up in the Dockerfiles, and deploying a new version of the application that runs on a more recent update of Ubuntu or whatever is the same whether you’re renting machines in the cloud or running your own. Don’t you need a world-class team of super engineers to do this? I never shy away from an opportunity to brag about the great people we have working at 37signals, because I’m legitimately proud of the team we’ve assembled here. But it would be beyond hubris to claim that they have some special magical insights that are allowing them to operate our own hardware, which just isn’t otherwise available. The internet got going in 1995. Cloud as the default choice didn’t happen until maybe 2015. So for well over twenty years, companies have been operating hardware to run their applications. This isn’t some archaic knowledge that’s been lost to the ages. We might not know exactly how the pyramids were built, but we do still know how to connect a Linux machine to the internet. Besides, 90% of the expertise needed to run your own hardware is the same as what’s needed to run in the cloud. At least once you get to our scale with millions of users and hundreds of thousands of dollars in monthly bills. Does this mean you’re building your own data centers? Nobody is building their own data centers, outside the hyperscalers and a handful of other mega companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta. Almost everyone else simply rents a couple or cabinets or a room or a floor at a professional data center operator, like Equinix. So owning your own hardware does not mean having to worry about security, or power delivery, or fire-suppression systems, or any of the other details that go into these facilities that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to create. But what about racking and stacking servers and pulling network cables? Who does that? We use a white-glove data center service provider called Deft. There are tons of other companies like them. And you pay them to unpack the boxes that arrive from Dell, or whoever you buy from, straight to the data center, then they stack it, rack it, and you see the IP address come online. Just like the cloud, even if it isn’t instant. Our operations team basically never set foot in our data centers. They’re working remotely from all over the world. The operating experience is far more like that of the cloud than it is the early days of the internet when everyone drew their own cabling. What about reliability? Doesn’t the cloud do that for you? When we were running in the cloud, we were using two geographically-dispersed regions, and plenty of redundancy within each region. That’s exactly what we’re doing now that we’re out of the cloud. We host our own hardware in two geographically-dispersed data centers, each data center is capable of carrying the full load we need, and every critical piece of infrastructure has replicas. Reliability is largely a function of redundancy. You should be able to lose any computer, any component, at any time, without that being a problem. We had that in the cloud, we have that with our own hardware. How about international performance? Isn’t cloud faster? Our previous cloud setup used two different regions within the US, and then it used a CDN network with local edge nodes all over the world. That’s the same story, again, like reliability, with our cloud exit. We use two data centers in the US, and we use an international CDN to speed up content delivery. It’s fundamentally the same equation. The hard part about international footprints is usually not securing a data center or setting up hardware, but designing your application to deal with multiple primary databases for writing, dealing with replication lag, and all the other fun stuff it takes to make applications fast on a global internet. We’re currently planning an outpost experiment for HEY with a data center in Europe, and we’re just leaning on our friends at Deft to set that up. As with all hardware procurement, it does take longer to get that delivered than cloud. Nothing beats the cloud for “I want 10 servers online in Japan” and seeing it happen 30 seconds later. It’s amazing. But for our kind of business, the insane premium you have to pay for that kind of instant bootstrapping just isn’t worth it. Waiting a couple of weeks to see servers come online is a completely tolerable trade-off. Did you factor in what it costs to replace your servers later? Yes, we did our math on the basis of servers lasting five years. That’s conservative. We’ve had servers go 7-8 years, working great. But five years is usually the interval used by most people, and it makes for easy financial comparisons. But here’s the kicker. We spent $600,000 buying a ton of new servers. We’ve already paid that investment off with the savings secured by leaving the cloud! So if some amazing technological breakthrough happens next year, and we want to buy a bunch of new stuff again, we can easily do that and still be ahead on the math. What about privacy regulations and GDPR? Clouds don’t offer you any real advantages when it comes to privacy regulations and GDPR. If anything, it’s a negative aspect, because all the major hyperscalers are American. So if you’re in Europe, and you’re buying cloud services from Microsoft or Amazon or Google, you’re still liable to the fact that the US government can legally compel these providers to hand over data and records. So, if anything, you’re better off owning your own hardware and running it from a European data center provider, if strict compliance with GDPR is key to your setup as a European company. What about bursts in demand? What about autoscaling? The shocking thing about buying your own hardware is realizing both how cheap and how powerful it’s become. The progress in the last 4-5 years alone has been immense. This is one of the reasons that much of the cloud is getting to be a worse deal by the year. Moore’s Law is hammering the prices and increasing the capabilities of stuff you buy from Dell and others. But it’s scarcely moving the needle on the price you have to pay Amazon and others for their managed services. That’s all to say that you can afford to dramatically over provision your own hardware to give you ample headroom to deal with spikes, and it’ll barely make a difference in the long-run budget. That said, if you regularly do face 5-10x or higher spikes in demand over baseline, you may indeed be a good candidate for cloud. This was after all the original incentive behind AWS. That Amazon needed way, way, WAY more performance on Black Friday or Cyber Monday than they did the rest of the year. So flexible hardware made sense. But you can also mix and match. The saying goes “buy the baseline, rent the spike”. Many companies won’t even need to bother with that, though. Just buy some powerful machines a fair step ahead of your growth curve, keep an eye on usage over time, and if you have to make an unplanned expansion, you can usually have a whole other fleet of servers online in a week or so. How much are you spending on service contracts and licensing fees? Nothing. Everything you need to run applications on the internet is generally available as open source. We run open source versions of everything we were running in the cloud. Our RDS databases became MySQL 8. Our OpenSearch became open source ElasticSearch. Some companies may indeed like the comfort of a service contract, and there are plenty of providers out there who can offer one. We’ve on/off used the great services of Percona for their MySQL specialists. It doesn’t fundamentally change the underlying equation. Although you do have to stay clear of the most enterprisey outfits. Typically if they have banks or governments on their client list, you ought to look elsewhere, unless you just like setting money on fire. If cloud is so expensive, why did you ever go there? Because we bought the marketing pitch. That it was going to be cheaper, easier, and faster. Only the last promise ever really came through for us. The cloud makes it really fast to provision a whole fleet of servers. But that’s just not something we do very often, so it’s not worth a huge premium. But we spent years trying to unlock the savings from “economies of scale” and “ease of use”, but it just never really happened. The managed services still needed management. The advances from Moore’s Law rarely got passed on as savings. In hindsight, I’m actually glad we did give the cloud a proper go. We learned a lot, and we improved our processes as a result. But I do wish we’d done the math a couple of years sooner.", "date": "2023-12-19T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

A few years ago, I remember reading about forest bathing. The idea that spending time walking in nature lowered blood pressure and stress significantly more than walking the same distance in a city. I completely believe it. It’s become a cliche, “touch grass”, but it’s also true. Your life will literally be longer, healthier, and happier, if you let nature wash over you regularly. That’s one of the reasons why I’m such a fan of remote work. Imagine taking that hour or two of commuting – which, when done in rush hour by car, is perhaps one of the most blood pressure and stress raising activities known to man! – and trading that in for a walk in the forest or the garden or any form of wilderness.", "date": "2023-12-14T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

My father repaired electronics, so an endless stream of speakers, amplifiers, turntables, and TVs passed through the household. And all of it had to be tested, of course. At max volume. Sometimes at odd hours. While that was frequently a bit of a nuisance, it did seed a deep appreciation for musical experiences in me. Founded on the fact that music can sound very differently depending on the equipment that conveys it. But most of my life, I’ve listened to music in one of two more dull settings: Using noise canceling headphones while traveling and in the background while working at a desk. Neither of those two settings are usually conducive to “musical experiences”. Most of the home offices I’ve used haven’t had good acoustics, and there’s only so much you can do with a pair of Bluetooth headphones that also have to compete with the roar of flight. Every now and then, though, I’d be reminded of what was possible when listening to music in a media room or at friend’s house with a real HiFi setup. And I’d be reminded of those childhood years, when a piece of music flowed through some great speakers and produced a transcendent experience. I don’t even have a great pair of ears. The left side has a permanent 5% loss of hearing, and the right side is average at best. But that’s the thing about a great HiFi setup, you don’t have to be a connoisseur or be blessed with reference-grade aural hardware in your head to enjoy it. It’s as easy to tell the difference as that between watching a movie on a VHS tape and seeing it from blue-ray on a 4K projector. And that’s what it feels like right now, as I sit at my desk in front of a pair of KEF LSX-II speakers, lost in listening to my favorite tunes, discovering new notes and instruments in the fresh detail. Like I’m sitting in front of 4K projector, soaked in vivid colors and perfect blacks. It’s mesmerizing, and I’m kicking myself for not upgrading sooner. But I really didn’t think it was possible to get this kind of sound in my Malibu office. It’s got a beautiful view, but it’s full of hard surfaces, which ruin acoustics. So I had resigned myself to that VHS quality flowing from mediocre speakers in the ceiling to fill the background. That’s when the magic of X lead me to the KEFs. A couple of people chimed in on the thread about my new desk look, and recommended I have a look at the LSX-IIs. So I did. Not even so much because I thought about the sound quality, but because I liked how they looked, and that they were more proportional to the rest of the desk in size compared to the TUKs. So I came for the aesthetics, but I was blown away by the sound. I’ve been glued in front of these speakers for hours now, just listening to all the tracks I thought I knew so well. Constantly uncovering new facets and depth in the music. That to me is HiFi. Music rendered so purely, so broadly, so detailed that it can’t help but step out of the background and take center stage. Sure, you can get nuts with it, like everything, and start chasing gold-platted cables and purer forms of electricity to avoid interference. I mean, if that’s you, great, it’s fun to have a hobby! But for me, and probably many others, a fully integrated set of KEF LSX-IIs connected with USB C to a computer streaming Apple Music Lossless is probably the peak of what we can appreciate anyway in an office setting. But what a damn peak it is! So thank you, kind strangers on the internet, for pointing me towards these remarkable desk speakers. They're sublime.", "date": "2023-12-10T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Not to talk about grandiose words like 'legacy'. But I'm willing to make an exception here, and actually use that word, 'legacy', because it's been on my mind lately. Perhaps it's because I recently turned 44. That's past the halfway point for the average human in every society around the world. Which by cliche is when a fair number of people really start to consider their mortality (and freak out about it!). I feel like Stoicism has given me a good head start on contemplating mortality, though. I've had Memento Mori (latin for 'remember death') on my phone background many times over the years. So it's less about mortality per se, and more, like Clayton Christensen would ask, That's the kind of legacy I care about.

And in just a month's worth of ownership. This is a car that now retails for $86,090 in the US. About the same as an Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio or a BMW M3 with a couple of options. Expensive, premium cars, but far from the realm of the brands mentioned above. And yet, somehow, it's proven itself to be as special and as exotic as those luxury and aspirational brands, in its own way. Even as it looks nearly the same as every other Model S that's been multiplying on the roads in the past 13 years. It's mostly about the drivetrain. Which in an EV like the Tesla basically just means the electric motors. The Plaid has three. Two in the rear (one for each wheel), and one on the front. It has a single-speed transmission. So far, so normal. But what's not normal is that the combined output is over 1,000 horsepower. That sounds like an absolutely ridiculous, possibly even unsafe, amount of power, and yet the Tesla makes these mega horses seem perfectly reasonable, approachable, and controllable. But never boring. And as much as I enjoy the wailing engine note of a V10 or the perfect resonance of a V12, the immediacy and the power of an EV motor with over a ton of horses and instant torque is in many ways equally if differently compelling. This is where many non-car people make their usual mistake: But where can you even use 1,000 horsepower!? How often would you take this to a track? And the answer is: All the time, and you don't have to. Every day driving offers you plenty of opportunities to revel in the rollercoaster fun of going 10-60, 30-70, 0-50 mph at supersonic speeds in a perfectly safe and controlled manner. Every stoplight, every onramp. Every stretch of empty road. The pleasure of power isn't about top speed, it's about acceleration, and I have never, ever owned a car that accelerates like the Model S Plaid in these intervals. It's intoxicating and addictive, in the best, most wholesome possible way. See the other magic trick of EVs is their ability to control all that power on each individual wheel with millisecond response time. Something you simply can't do with an internal combustion engine that's propelling you forward by a series of miniature explosions inside a single engine block. An old school gasoline-powered car can feel scary with as little as 300-400 horsepower. Traction breaks, you need quick hands to catch it. That's the frame of reference anyone who've driven a fast, regular car would have. But it doesn't apply at all in the EV world. I haven't once gotten the Plaid bent out of shape in a way that either surprised or scared me. Something that has happened countless times on spirited drives in old school cars. The traction control in an EV car doles out exactly the right amount of power for the grip available. In such a subtle way that you basically can't tell. The result is exotic. Even if it's a different kind of exotic from a set of Italian cylinders producing a symphony out a set of quad exhaust pipes. And, unlike that old school kind of exotica, it's far more accessible. Very few people will ever end up owning a great Ferrari V12 or a Porsche V10. Lots and lots of people will either own or get a ride in Tesla Plaid. That's progress! It's the kind of democratizing progress that Warhol talks about when he quips that the billionaire and the bum both have access to the best soft drink in the world: A Coca Cola. Okay, so a $86,000 car isn't exactly a can of coke, but in a couple of years, that car will be worth $40,000, and suddenly you'll be within striking range of upper-end-of-average car prices. Remarkable. Now I've gushed about the power here, but the other half of the story is that the handling is far, far better than I expected. I've owned and driven a Tesla Model X for many years, and I somehow mistakenly thought that car would feel about the same as the Model S in the bends. It does not. The Model S handles with 90% the aplomb of a Porsche Taycan, which to me is the benchmark of EV driving, and a fantastic handling car in any company. And that's before we even get to the livability of the Model S. It's insane practicable, has perhaps the best software in the business, and manages to make its austere cabin seem luxurious in a Scandinavian stark sense. When I drive this car, I don't miss the Porsche. I barely even miss the plushness of a Bentley. This is not the conclusion I expected to draw! I ordered the Model S on Even if you're an incarnate petrol head, you owe yourself a ride in a Plaid, and I will almost guarantee that you'll feel better about the future. I'm not saying that the internal combustion engine doesn't have plenty of emotional appeal or that a track day car is fun at 4,000 pounds, but I am saying that I love cars, and I love the Model S. Do with that testimony as you please, just don't discount the possibility it might hold true for you as well. What a ride.", "date": "2023-10-31T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

All on the premise that we'd work towards becoming profitable, remaining in the country, and Workfeed makes employee scheduling software. That might sound pretty boring, but if you run or work at a restaurant (or store or anywhere else in the service industry!) still trying to do things with Excel spreadsheets or call sheets, you know this can be a huge pain and time suck. That's exactly the kind of drudgery that software was meant to solve, and Workfeed does an amazing job at this. What I found interesting about employee scheduling software is how localized much of it is. You need integrations with payroll and other employee systems to make inroads, and many of those solutions are anchored in the particulars of local labor laws, customs, and industry standards. It's quite unlike the universality afforded Jason and I working on something like Basecamp. That also means entering a new territory is much harder. Workfeed got started in Denmark, quickly became the top-rated system there, blazed past a bunch of stale competitors, and built a profitable, successful business primarily on the basis of this market alone. But Denmark is tiny. Less than 6 million people. So since day one, I've been pushing them to get ready for the biggest software market in the world: America. Now the day has finally come! Workfeed is bringing their Danish design and sensibilities to the US service industry. They've done a bunch of homework already, created a handful of key integrations, but could really use some help perfecting their solution for America. And, as a proud Dane now living in America, and as an investor in the company, I'm hoping that I can help them get just that. So. If you run, or knows someone who runs, a service business, whether that's a restaurant, a store, or whatever, which needs to schedule employee time for shifts in America, That's a pretty good deal, if you ask me, and it's a way to help a Danish startup fulfill the hypothesis that it's possible to build awesome SaaS solutions without going down the venture rabbit hole.

Willfully imagining all manner of terrible things that might befall you, but haven't yet. Described like this, it sorta sounds like a fancy word of anxiety, but if you look closer, it's in fact its opposite. The point of visualizing the consequences of an accident, the loss of a loved one, or the bankruptcy of your business is not to stew in despair, but to prepare yourself for the inevitability of hardship. Nobody makes it through life entirely on easy mode, and if you haven't done any manner of mental preparation, even small setbacks can seem calamitous. So you really ought to prepare. In this way, negative visualization is like the dojo in The Matrix. It's a way to level up your skills inside a simulation running within your mind's eye. A chance to realize that \"there is no spoon\" in the sense that a given external event forces a given internal response. With enough training, you can disconnect the two, and become far better at choosing your response to almost any stimuli. In my book, that's even better than knowing Kung Fu! In addition to building up your resilience, negative visualization also offers a path to gratitude. However bad things might seem in the moment, you can usually imagine something even worse, which should make the present seem far more tolerable. That ideal of being able to bear any hardship life has to offer is key to Stoicism in general. One which it shares with plenty of other philosophical traditions. The modern self-help guru Jim Rohn, for example, presents this as \"don't wish it was easier, wish you were better\". But beyond all the inner work you can do with negative visualization, I really enjoy putting the insights into external practice as well. That's how I've become so attached to the concept of The One Person Framework in my open source work. I'm putting my negative visualization into action, and getting ready for the end of my life's work. I've been getting ready like this for the better part of twenty years, even though things have, actually, mostly been both easy and prosperous. But businesses go bankrupt all the time. Markets change, accidents and malice happens, and entropy is always at the door. I want to be ready, because being ready is the ticket to being calm. If you know and accept that the gravy train might stop at any station, you dissipate the fear associated with not knowing when or where it might do so. That's incredibly powerful and liberating. So that's what I'm doing when I charge at the merchants of complexity, working on tools and frameworks to empower the individual. I'm setting up my own situation for starting over from scratch with no capital, no staff, no advantages. Only the tools and the skills I've built and learned along the way. It's ironic that it becomes so much easier to enjoy working on the business after you've accepted that it might end at any time, but it's true. The Buddhists have this as key to their teachings, that attachment is suffering, too. (Proving that most of the deepest insights into the human condition were uncovered by multiple traditions independently.) So I encourage you to give negative visualization a try. And after you've done that, to put it into action. Things can always get worse and you can always get better.", "date": "2023-10-30T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

This shift has reduced our monthly cloud costs by 60%. Among the changes we made was a shift of all media/blob artifacts out of the cloud, which reduced our overall cloud data storage size by 60%, and separately, we succeeded in reducing cloud data processing costs by 75%.\" Read that again. Reduced the monthly cloud cost by 60%(!!) by moving work out of the cloud and onto their own servers. According to [earlier reports](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/twitter-aws), X was spending $100 million per year with AWS, so if we take that as a base, they're on track to save $60m/year from the cloud exit achievements so far. Wild! What's even more impressive than the fact they've been able to cut their cloud bill so much, so quickly is that they've done it with a team a quarter the size of what it was. Twitter used to have some 8,000 employees, and X reportedly now have less than 2,000. This is not going to go by unnoticed by CFOs and investors. If it's possible, and Musk is busy proving that it is, to run an operation like X with a quarter the staff, and STILL profit massively from exiting the cloud, you know there are gigantious savings waiting to be unlocked from leaving the cloud at most large corporations in many cases.

The fallacy that past failed attempts dictates the scope of what's possible. That just because someone, somewhere, one time attempted something similar and failed, nobody else should try. That lowering our collective ambition to whatever was unachievable by others is somehow good. There would be no human progress if we all quit trying after any unsuccessful attempt. This fallacy is bad enough when it talks about what hasn’t yet successfully been achieved, but it’s downright bewildering when it’s trotted out to refute the reality of what’s already been proven possible. Take the example of building fast, modern web applications with #NoBuild JavaScript. We've been running HEY without bundling or compiling JavaScript for three years now (you can sign up and View Source to see exactly how!). We have tens of thousands of happy, paying customers, and we've made millions in profits from this product. Yet certain quarters of the dev discourse continue to insist what we've done isn't possible. Wat? It's like insisting your map is correct even after it failed to record the massive mountain you're literally staring at. Refusing to believe reality because it doesn't comport to your mental model of the world is an intellectual failure state. Part of that outdated mental map of what's possible on the web includes the notion that #NoBuild JavaScript inevitably leads to slow applications. That you'll drown in the waterfall of requests cascading through your dependencies. Here's a report from Google's web performance tool Lighthouse. HEY literally gets a perfect 100/100 score on performance: Now yes, that's because HEY is built differently from, say, Khan Academy or Vercel. We don't have hundreds of dependencies or thousands of JavaScript files. We send about ~100 individual JavaScript files over HTTP/2, and only rely on a handful of external libraries, mostly Hotwire. That's how progress usually happens! By someone doing something different than whoever went before them in pursuit of the same goal. But instead of recognizing that, and perhaps becoming just a bit curious at how it was done, the \"we tried that, didn't work\" fallacy sucks people into the small world of \"can't\". Making programming better requires a willingness to test your priors. To question your assumptions. To recognize the half-life of facts. Yes, how we built HEY wasn't feasible prior to 2020, before import maps opened the door. So if your mental model of the web is soaked in the possibilities of 2010-2020, I understand your skepticism, but please don't let it restrict your ability to appreciate the progress happening now. None of this is an argument that everyone should follow us into this glorious #NoBuild future. I've retired from trying to convince anyone who's happily making stuff with other tools that they must change their ways. I'm sharing how we're building HEY because it not only works, but works exceptionally well for us. Do with that testimony and technology as you please. But when you're building with small teams, or even alone, you need all the conceptual compression you can get. Nothing compresses what you need to know like removing an entire step from the equation. That's always been what excited my about building for the web, from Ruby on Rails through Hotwire through everything.

Really fast. Infinitely fast. Here's a tongue-in-cheek slide I featured as part of my Rails World keynote last week talking about this No Build process: Now I fully understand why someone might want to use esbuild or bun, and I've gone out of my way to work on great tooling for Rails to make that really easy. Rails 7.1 ships with native support for bun in the box, and esbuild is already compiling JavaScript for lots of Rails applications in production (including Basecamp!). These are great tools, and I'm thrilled they work so well with Rails. But for the first time in probably 15 years, the state of the art is no longer finding more sophisticated ways to build JavaScript or CSS. It's not to build at all. To lean on HTTP/2 and the now universal support for import maps to avoid bundling, and to lean on the fundamental progress in support for modern JavaScript and CSS to avoid compiling what browsers already know how to read. If you aren't wedded to React, Vue, or whatever, you should have a look at what's possible to build with Hotwire and No Build these days. You just might want to shed the weight of complexity and enjoy the lighter stack.", "date": "2023-10-11T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

The internet is often a poor guide for what people really think or what they really want. It's like making a new product. Until customers put their credit card in the form, you don't actually know what you've got. So this is that moment for The Rails Foundation. The rubber-hits-the-road moment. And we couldn't have dreamed of a better launch. Everything came together to produce an absolutely electric vibe at the conference. I don't recall breathing such an air of excitement, of renewal, and of optimism since the very earliest days of Ruby on Rails. In fact, so much new stuff got introduced during this conference that we, in the Rails ecosystem, will easily spend the next several months digesting it all. From the announcement and immediate availability of Solid Cache, Strada, Kamal 1.0, as well as the previews for Turbo 8, Solid Queue, and Mission Control, my own keynote have newer been so jam-packed with fun new toys for all to share. Many others brought many more. But it's clear that all the good vibes came from more than the sparkle of new announcements. It was as much due to the sparkle of real and deep interactions between people who were genuinely excited to see each other. Some because this was their first Rails conference, some because it was the first big Rails conference in Europe since the 2000s, and many because it had simply been too long. We also managed to assemble the largest gathering of the Rails core team ever in Amsterdam. The ten of us, only missing Guillermo and Ryuta, got to spend some quality time together, sharing meals, discussing the future of Rails, and just recharging those social batteries the way you can only do in person. The core team consists of people whom I've worked with on the most consequential open source project of my career, in several cases for over a decade, but mostly remotely. Having fun together again, in real life, was truly a special treat. So too was meeting countless people who professed to owe the joy of their programming endeavors to Ruby on Rails. Along with so many who've managed to build successful businesses, small and large, on this framework I started back in 2003. I must have done a hundred selfies with people, and ended up spending the majority of the conference just talking to folks from all ends of the experience spectrum. You know how they say social media isn't real life? Rails World was the perfect illustration of that. When so much of our online discourse is sadly soaked in salty or sour interactions, we need the sweetness of being together like this to provide an antidote. Coming together around our common goals and shared interests, rather than constantly marinating in our differences, whether they be technical, cultural, or political. This is how you push up a large tent. So thank you. Really. Thank you to everyone who came up to me to share their Rails story, to take a picture together, who, together with the incredible speaker line-up, made this conference the best possible birthday gift an open source creator and maintainer could ever wish for. And finally thank you to Amanda Perino. Our executive director of The Rails Foundation who in just a few short months after starting a new job had to make big calls to the tunes of many hundreds of thousands of dollars to organize this incredible event in very little time at all. Impeccable execution! I can't wait to see even more people from the Rails ecosystem at Rails World 2024 in Toronto next year.

Each should come with the name of the person who made it. You should never accept that a requirement came from a department, such as from \"the legal department\" or \"the safety department.\" You need to know the name of the real person who made that requirement. Then you should question it, no matter how smart that person is. Requirements from smart people are the most dangerous, because people are less likely to question them. Always do so, even if the requirement came from me. Then make the requirements less dumb.**Delete any part or process you can**. You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn't delete enough.**Simplify and optimize**. This should come after step two. common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that should not exist.**Accelerate cycle time**. Every process can be speeded up. But only do this after you have followed the first three steps. In the Tesla factory, I mistakenly spent a lot of time accelerating processes that I later realized should have been deleted.**Automate**. That comes last. The big mistake in Nevada and at Fremont was that I began by trying to automate every step. We should have waited until all the requirements had been questioned, parts and processes deleted, and the bugs were shaken out. This is not just a succinct distillation of a practical and powerful work method but one for a successful company culture too. And this is how Musk runs his companies. Isaacson's book is easily worth the read for the countless case studies illustrating exactly how these points are applied. The trick to getting the best out of Musk's method is to realize that you needn't celebrate the madness as much as merely accept that it's part of a package deal. Like it so often is. One of the memorable quotes from the book reveals that even Musk himself realizes this: \"Did you think I was just going to be a normal, chill dude?\". You can absolutely learn from people you wouldn't want to be. Extracting wisdom from Musk's success does not oblige you to become his disciple or his mirror. Besides, you'd probably fail miserably in an attempt of the latter anyway. A key reason Musk gets away with his madness is that the missions he pursue can motivate people to persevere in spite of him. So unless you're also trying to single-handedly accelerate the energy transition of earth or attempting to colonize Mars, you'd best dilute his example accordingly. That seems to be a lesson that's currently lost to the ages. The ability to appreciate, applaud, and even partly appropriate elements of a character you'd never wish to swallow whole. I can shake my head as much as anyone about some of Musk's antics, and yet still be ever-so-pleased that he's here, doing what he does. Most founders and executives would do well to add at least 10% of Musk's intensity to their personal recipe.

While there are some additional other costs associated with the extra servers, it's relative peanuts in the grand scheme (our ops team stayed the same, for example). Which means that by the basic comparison of money saved vs money spent, we'll be in the money on the big purchase with the current monthly savings in less than six months. That's just astounding! Let's see where things end up when it's all said and done, but we don't have to squint hard to see the eventual savings climb all the way up to about $2m/year.

To have so many key advocates engage or encourage this kind of behavior, this kind of slander, and this kind of hooliganism against those who don't share their team colors is frankly embarrassing. It's also a weird exhibition of self-loathing in the choice of technology. TypeScript is JavaScript! It's a superset that sprinkles an appearance of type safety on top of a weakly- and dynamically-typed language. To muster such rabid animosity towards anyone celebrating the use of the subset is but an illustration of the ferocity and visciousness of minor differences. That's the eternal wisdom of bikeshed parable. That when the stakes are low, the debate more easily becomes nasty. Showing up for a fight on something so ultimately unresolvable as whether to use compiler-based type checking or not offers the thrill of hooliganism.

Just because Turbo 8 is dropping TypeScript won't mean you can't write your client code in it, or use any other library that employs it. We get to mix and match, which is wonderful. It's also necessary. Because unlike languages like Ruby, which are languages of choice when it comes to the server side, JavaScript is a language of necessity when it comes to the client side. While you may compile dialects into it, you still have to accept the fact that running code in the browser means running JavaScript. So being able to write that, free of any tooling, and free of any strong typing, is a blessing under the circumstances. So farewell, TypeScript.

Things that should be easy become hard, and things that are hard become `any`. No thanks! This isn't a plea to convert anyone of anything, though. As I discussed in Programming types and mindsets, very few programmers are typically interested in having their opinion on typing changed. Most programmers find themselves drawn strongly to typing or not quite early in their career, and then spend the rest of it rationalizing The Correct Choice to themselves and others.That's part of the magic of this JavaScript v TypeScript dichotomy, and full credit to the TypeScript gang for realizing that a full take-over of JavaScript was never going to happen, so complete compatibility had to be baked in from the start. Just because Turbo 8 is dropping TypeScript won't mean you can't write your client code in it, or use any other library that employs it. We get to mix and match, which is wonderful. It's also necessary. Because unlike languages like Ruby, which are languages of choice when it comes to the server side, JavaScript is a language of necessity when it comes to the client side. While you may compile dialects into it, you still have to accept the fact that running code in the browser means running JavaScript. So being able to write that, free of any tooling, and free of any strong typing, is a blessing under the circumstances. So farewell, TypeScript. May you bring much rigor and satisfaction to your tribe while letting the rest of us enjoy JavaScript in the glorious spirit it was originally designed: Free of strong typing.", "date": "2023-09-06T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

If it's a problem with engagement – their style of collaboration, their communication, their approach – there's a good chance you can fix it with some clear feedback. But if the problem is with core competency – their technical skills – you can't expect to solve that with a stern conversation. It's true that it might not be entirely clear in the early days of a new hire whether problems fall into one category or the other. But eventually it will be clear, and when it is, you have to act accordingly. Problems with engagement are often simply due to unstated assumptions. You expect someone to act a certain way, but they don't realize that, so they don't, and you're disappointed. If they knew what was the bother, they'd be able to correct. And you do neither you nor them any favors by sugarcoating or delaying the feedback. This is the essence of But if the problem turns out to be core competency – that they're simply not good enough at what they've been hired to do – you can't feedback your way out of that in any reasonable amount of time. At least not when the problem is with anyone but those in the most junior positions. If a programmer or a designer or a writer, or anyone else really, spent the last four-five-six years of their career getting their skills to where they are now, it's delusional to think that they can lift them to an entirely new level in just a month or two or even six just because you asked them firmly. The only time I've occasionally seen it pan out well is if the new hire was merely misclassified on the seniority ladder, but they actually do have solid chops to qualify for a lower level, and thus have a chance to (relatively quickly) grow into the expectations of the position they've been hire into. Say a lead developer who's actually more a senior, but with a couple of challenges could quickly get the last bit. It's still awkward, though, and one of the reasons why you rarely do anyone a favor by hiring them into a level of seniority that requires a big reach. Better to have them come in where they're solidly qualified, can dazzle against the expectations they can surely best, and then push a promotion from a surge of confidence and goodwill. Other than that, problems with core competency is the pit where good intentions go to die. It's the kind of issues that give performance plans a bad reputation. The impossible walks in the desert that don't have any realistic chance of leading out. Motions of bureaucracy conducted to produce a paper trail. The worst. So when that new hire isn't working out, make a point to distinguish whether the trouble is with core competency or engagement. Then make your best effort to turn around the relationship when it's engagement, but look for a quick end if it's competency. Don't waste your time or theirs asking for the impossible. It's true that it might not be entirely clear in the early days of a new hire whether problems fall into one category or the other. But eventually it will be clear, and when it is, you have to act accordingly. Problems with engagement are often simply due to unstated assumptions. You expect someone to act a certain way, but they don't realize that, so they don't, and you're disappointed. If they knew what was the bother, they'd be able to correct.

But the obsession with all things Elon is so strong that there’s no room or time for introspection of any kind. It’s just on to the next faux outrage of tomorrow. Make sure you never miss a chance to be an expert on social media, advertising, team building, economics, or branding so you can tell the world’s most successful entrepreneur what a total idiot he’s being, and how much smarter, wiser, and kinder you’d be in his shoes.

Primarily because of just how utterly removed the discourse around it is from a good-faith assessment of the merits of the particulars. It’s all turned into an endless proxy war, and every argument is wielded only in service of yet another petty ideological skirmish. Musk could double the revenue and users of X, and his perma detractors would still find a path back to a prophesy of imminent ruin. Likewise, he could lose half the revenue again, and his most ardent boosters would position the setback as merely part of an even grander master plan. This is 5D chess being played by two parties shuffling pieces around in isolated realms of reality, each cheering every move as but two removed from checkmate. Are you not entertained? That’s perhaps the only real question here.

And it's even bigger than before the pandemic, now that so many workers have had a taste of what life can be like when you don't have to commute to the office. This is great news for smaller companies and startups in particular. Let's face it, if you're trying to compete for talent with the likes of Google or Apple, you need all the help you can get, and these companies forcing everyone back into an office might just be your biggest lift. Because for quite a few people, working remotely or not has become the defining characteristic of a job. To the point where many remote workers won't even consider a position that involves a corporate office. This is doubly so for workers who don't live in the few big cities, which most major tech companies settle in. For whom taking tech job with a big company that insists office attendance would require leaving life, family, and their preferred location behind. The world is full of wonderful, talented people who won't do this. Right now job seekers might not have a choice, of course. After half a million tech workers got fired recently in the US, I'm sure the big tech companies aren't wanting for applicants – even if they force them into an office against their preference.

Let's face it, if you're trying to compete for talent with the likes of Google or Apple, you need all the help you can get, and these companies forcing everyone back into an office might just be your biggest lift. Because for quite a few people, working remotely or not has become the defining characteristic of a job. To the point where many remote workers won't even consider a position that involves a corporate office. This is doubly so for workers who don't live in the few big cities, which most major tech companies settle in. For whom taking tech job with a big company that insists office attendance would require leaving life, family, and their preferred location behind. The world is full of wonderful, talented people who won't do this. Right now job seekers might not have a choice, of course. After half a million tech workers got fired recently in the US, I'm sure the big tech companies aren't wanting for applicants – even if they force them into an office against their preference.

It's rare that a single project has the power to put your business at serious risk, and if so, just don't use that one as an opportunity to validate someone's untested promise. Besides, even if someone fails to rise to the occasion on a given project, there's usually plenty of time to step in with corrections or even a reassignment before it goes down in flames. The trick is to think of all your projects as a series of games. Whether you win or tie a few early ones matters far less than building your capacity to crush them consistently later. Giving everyone on your team the chance to be their absolute best as quickly as possible is how build that crushing capacity. This is hard to do consistently. It's much easier to tap your most trusted and proven employees when assembling the team for a challenging project. But every play you give to someone you know can do it, is a play you've kept from someone who might have been able to.

The market as a whole is up, and if you're in the whole market, you're benefitting. But all of that upside, basically, belongs to just a handful of mega tech companies. This is not a general turn-around, and it's barely a turn-around at all for the unprofitable SaaS companies that saw their bubble burst last year. In software, only cash spigots like Apple and Microsoft are able to set fresh all-time highs. Investors who bought into money pits like Asana, Monday, or Smartsheet are still likely to be in despair over their evaporated values. This is an important change from the marathon bull run that lifted all tech businesses, no matter how unprofitable or far-fetched, in the time from the Great Recession and until the peak at the end of 2021. We're now back in world where the actual business metrics and mechanics of individual operations determine the value assigned to their stocks and startups. But it also means that there's probably a lot more pain in the pipeline for unprofitable software startups, almost all of which are now SaaS, which raised money in the late go-go days. If a company raised a wallop of cash in 2021, they're soon coming up on that 18-month anniversary when it's supposed to be all spent. Now that runway has likely been extended by early cost-cutting, but those cuts won't last forever, and when fresh capital is inevitable needed, it'll be murder on the cap tables. Potential victims here include ClickUp, Airtable, and Notion. All who raised hundreds of millions at the peak of the market at insane valuations that'll be extremely difficult to live up to. But it's true that you can indeed continue to run a loss-making tech company for an impressively long time, once it's sucked in enough investment capital or exists in the public markets. Groupon, for example, was once valued at a staggering $25 billion. Now their market capitalization is down to $200m, and they're warning about the risks to being \"an ongoing return\", but the doors are still open – twelve years after they went public! Point being that, at a large enough scale, there's substantial lag between the infliction of a mortal financial wound and the final burial of the bleeding company. But you'd be silly, as an investor, employee, or customer, not to pay attention to the red drain once it's begun. Unless there's a sudden, swift turn-around in investor sentiments, and nothing is currently pointing to that for unprofitable enterprise SaaS in particular, I don't think we've seen anything yet.

This is a wonderful country and a wonderful capital.In fact, if you were to make a pro/con list contrasting family life in Denmark vs America, I think even fairly conservative parents from the US would find it difficult to compose a slam-dunk case for God's own country. I have perhaps never spent serious time in a major city so well-designed for children as that of Copenhagen. Just the idea of giving up on letting our pre-teen zip around the city on the metro by himself seems like a big loss. But life isn't just a set of rational arguments for or against. As Dostoevsky in Notes from Undergroundputs it:Reason is an excellent thing, there's no disputing that, but reason is nothing but reason and satisfies only the rational side of man's nature, while will is a manifestation of the whole life, that is, of the whole human life including reason and all the impulses. And although our life, in this manifestation of it, is often worthless, yet it is life and not simply extracting square roots. Here I, for instance, quite naturally want to live, in order to satisfy all my capacities for life, and not simply my capacity for reasoning, that is, not simply one twentieth of my capacity for life. What does reason know? Reason only knows what it has succeeded in learning. Reason as simply one twentieth of my capacity for life is one of those insights that immediately and permanently marked my soul after I first read it. And it squares perfectly with recent interest in the little brain in the heart, and the concept of the second brain of the body, which encompasses our gut as well. You can draw a connection to Sowell's expositionof unarticulated wisdom too. Just because we can't quite put words to the argument doesn't make it invalid. But the best articulation I can make is that Denmark works so well as it does because it's a small, homogenous society with strong norms that force a stringent cultural conformity. This has a world of benefits, and presents perhaps the most compelling case for the kind of capitalist-collectivist hybrid that the ideal image of a socially-democratic state possibly could. It also breeds a small box for acceptable manners, thinking, and being. How could it not. If we realize that our benefits are reaped by our collective sameness, then any material otherness is a threat. And because the monoculture, to its credit and celebration, is so strong, it also means it's full of implicit sink holes for the uninitiated to fall through. Americans and Danes share such a grand overlap in popular culture that it's easy to miss this at first. And we sorta did, when we lived the first part of our time here in the cozy comfort of the expat bubble. It wasn't until we gave the promise of long-term integration a proper go that the fault lines emerged. Again, I can't fault the Danes for guarding the intricate, delicate web of norms, customs, values, and appearances. We've seen how fragile the social contract can be around the world. So when you have something good going, and as always find it hard to pin exactly whyit's this good, you're naturally loathe to tinker too much with the recipe. I salute that! But it's also meant that in important ways, this country had a hard time becoming home, deep in our hearts, however persuasive the argument was to our heads. Maybe we'll be back at some point, but for now, I'm just ever so grateful that we got an amazing three years. And now I'm looking forward to being back in the whirlwind of America.

If you only need a plough thrice a year, it doesn't make much sense keeping it in the barn unused for the remaining 363 days.

The cloud is often just as complicated as running things yourself, and it's usually ridiculously more expensive. So if the money matters - to get out as well. But all that work to containerize our applications and prepare them for the cloud actually turned out to make it relatively easy to exit. And now, after six months of effort, it's done. We're out. The last application was brought home to our own hardware on Wednesday. Hallelujah!In those six months, we brought home six heritage services that we're no longer selling, but have committed to support for existing customers and users until the end of the internet. Basecamp Classic, Highrise, Writeboard, Campfire, Backpack, and Ta-da List are all over a decade old, but continue to serve tens of thousands of people, and generate millions of dollars in revenue. But now we'll be spending far less to operate them, and as a bonus to those users, provide a considerably faster experience due to the powerful new hardware.But the big move was HEY. This is an application that was born in the cloud. We'd never run it on our own hardware before, and as a full-featured email service, it had a lot of moving parts. But the team pulled this off without a hitch by doing the move in several stages, with different databases, cache servers, mail services, and app instances moving independently over the course of a few weeks.Our stack for bringing home all these applications is entirely open source. We use KVM to slice our new monster 192-thread Dell R7625s into isolated VMs, then Docker to run the containerized applications, and finally Kamal to do zero-downtime app deploys and rollbacks. This setup helped us dodge the complexity of Kubernetes, and avoid any sort of enterprisey service contract entanglements.The back of the napkin math is that we'll save at least $1.5 million per year by owning our own hardware rather than renting it from Amazon. And crucially, we've been able to do this without changing the size of the operations team at all. Running our applications in the cloud just never provided the promised productivity gains to do with any smaller of a team anyway.This is possible because the way we operate our own hardware actually isn't too dissimilar from how people use rental clouds like AWS. We buy new hardware from Dell, have it shipped directly to the two data centers we use, and ask the white-glove service hands at Deft to rack the new machines. Then we see the new IP addresses pop online, and can immediately put them to work with KVM/Docker/Kamal.The main difference here is the lag time between needing new servers and seeing them online. It truly is incredible that you can spin up 100 powerful machines in the cloud in just a few minutes, but you also pay dearly for the privilege.

Look at it this way. We spent about half a million dollars buying two pallets of servers from Dell, which added a combined 4,000 vCPUs with 7,680 GB of RAM and 384TB of NVMe storage to our server capacity. This hardware was more than adequate to run all the heritage services we brought home, together with HEY, and give our other Basecamp operations a hardware refresh. And it was less than a third the cost of what we predict we'll be saving EVERY YEAR! This is hardware we'll be amortizing over five years.No wonder that sharing our experience with this cloud exit has made a lot of companies think twice about the insane cloud rental bills they're incurring every month. Our collective cloud budget last year was $3.2m, and this was incredibly optimized, with long service commitments, scrupulous right-sizing and monitoring. There are lots of companies paying many times what we did for even less benefit. The potential savings are as large as the AWS quarterly results are staggering.AWS generated over $5 billion in profits for Amazon just in 2022 Q4!As I've mentioned before, I still think the cloud has a place for companies early enough in their lifecycle that the spend is either immaterial or the risk that they won't be around in 24 months is high.

Would you have guessed that hosting a company meet-up in US was almost twice as expensive as Europe? I wouldn't! I feel like Americans often complain about how expensive things are in Europe, but looking at our expenditures on meet-ups, that just isn't so. Here's what we spent per person in the three most recent locations, all-in: I feel like Americans often complain about how expensive things are in Europe, but looking at our expenditures on meet-ups, that just isn't so. Here's what we spent per person in the three most recent locations, all-in: - Miami: $6,200 - Amsterdam: $3,500 - New Orleans: $5,700 And as much as I liked both Miami and New Orleans, I felt like we ate far better in Amsterdam! Accommodations were of comparable quality. Perhaps, again, a tad more charming in Amsterdam than Miami, but New Orleans was pretty nice too. One of the surprising expenses in the US was just getting around. In Miami, we spent well over $10,000 just on cabs and Ubers. Whereas in Amsterdam, the cost was a fraction for the public transit options. (Although I guess neither could match the fun of a New Orleans marching band with full police escort 😄). 37signals is pretty evenly split these days between the US and the rest of the world. About half and half. So on that factor alone, I would have expected us to save a bunch on travel by staying within the US, but that just wasn't so. Either way, doing these meet-ups isn't cheap. We do them twice per year. But then again, we no longer have any expenses for an office, so that offsets quite a bit. We used to spend a good $25,000/month on the Chicago lease and associated bills. That was an office used by less than a handful of people on a regular basis! But one thing is the cost, another is the value. These meet-ups leave such a lasting impression on everyone who participates. It's a super dose of human connection, combined with a fun trip, and some excellent eating. We plan every single one of our company meet-ups in Basecamp. It's a lot of work to pull this off for just under 80 people, but with Basecamp making sure nothing falls between cracks, it's a lot easier than it would be with a tangled mess of chat, emails, and google docs scattered to the wind. If you're running a remote company, especially an internationally remote one, I strongly recommend finding a way to fit meet-ups into the budget. If not twice a year, then at least once.

By then, the rollercoaster that is the 24 Hours of Le Mans had already been going for ten hours. Oh, and we were a lap down on the leaders in our class. Doh! I've never had the race go that long before getting into the car. Usually by midnight, I'll have driven at least a good two hours of the required minimum six. But this edition of Le Mans also had more drama than any of the previous nine attempts I've been part of. At the end of the race, 22 cars had retired from crashes or mechanical issues, and several more were limping home many laps down. It was mayhem. Which started right from the words green, green, green. By the first chicane down the Mulsanne straight, a Cadillac in the class above us crashed hard immediately in front of my team mate Pietro Fittipaldi, who had to brake and swerve to avoid the carnage, dropping us from first down to fourth position in class. Not that the position really matters that early in the race, as long as you have the pace of the leading cars, which we did (at least in the beginning). We ended up completing 316 laps, or 4,305 kilometers, across the full 24 hours, so where things stood at lap 2 was never going to matter that much. But you still like to be out in front. It's good for morale. So of course we all cheered breathlessly when Pietro, as one of the only drivers, dared stay out on slick tires when the monsoon rain fell a few hours into the race. That allowed us to jump right back up to the front, as everyone who'd (sensibly!) gone to wet tires had to pit again to go back to the slicks. Running out front, my other team mate, and fellow Dane, Oliver Rasmussen, made it look easy. With a solid 10-second lead over second place, Oliver just kept clocking in the laps, as the track got drier and quicker. And for over two hours, he kept the lead. Things were going almost too well! That's the danger of Le Mans. The race is so long that it's easy to start dreaming about results well before it's prudent. Given the fact that our car had been so fast during the test day and practice sessions, and given the fact that Oliver was cruising out in front, I foolishly did let in those intrusive fantasies of victory before I'd even gotten in the car. Never do that at Le Mans. Because after six hours, our troubles came. First, Oliver probably ran over some carbon-fiber debris on track, which delaminated a tire, and forced an unscheduled pitstop. That turned the 10-second lead into a 20-second deficit, but hey, that's what happens. Worse was that rain once again swept the track just two laps after we pitted, and it caught Oliver out. He crashed the car coming out of Tetre Rouge, but managed to keep the main damage squarely on the nose, which didn't take long to change. It still meant another pitstop, though, and now we were three minutes down. Freaking Le Mans! And that's why I waited so long to get back into the car. With conditions this treacherous, and now with the sun having set, I had absolutely no desire to hop into the car for the first laps then. Le Mans is a tricky track in the best of conditions. Pro drivers had already crashed plenty of cars in the light and the dry, and they'd crash many more in such ideal conditions before the race was over. So I didn't fancy my odds going out in the dark and the wet for the first run, which meant Pietro had to go back in. That was clearly the right call. Not only did Pietro make quick progress, which crucially kept us from turning that three-minute deficit into going a lap down. So when a safety car was finally called to deal with a myriad of simultaneous track incidents, we were brought right back into the fight. As the track went back to green, we were running fifth or sixth, just a few seconds behind the leader, and Pietro was poised to pass at least half the cars in front easily, as they had their amateur drivers in. Le Mans wanted it differently. Barely had the track gone green, and barely had our excitement of being back in the game subsided, before an overly-ambitious attempt at a pass into the first chicane landed our car in the gravel trap. Boom. That was it. Now we were a lap down for real, and any shot at a win essentially gone. That's the margin that makes this race so interesting. You can do literally hundreds of laps across the French countryside with perfect poise, and then you make one tiny mistake, in a split second, and it all goes away. Maybe it was knowing that we were already out of the running baring a miracle, maybe it was jumping in while the track was still very damp in places, and dark in all the others, but I didn't have a good first run. Sometimes you click with the car at Le Mans. Everything flows just right. The traffic comes just as you're able to make the key passes without losing anything. This wasn't one of those times. So I handed the car back to Oliver rather deflated, after that first run. You never know whether you're going to get another shot at running at Le Mans. This track literally only exists twice a year, the rest of the time it's mostly public roads. And if this was going to be my last impression, in case of a race-ending incident, that would have been a real bummer. Thankfully it wasn't. Now given the fact that I had waited nearly half the race to get into the car for the first time, I ended up having to do almost half of what was left in the race once I got going. So at 7:30 in the morning, I got back in the car for another two-hour run, and this time the car and me did click. It's a strange sensation, but in some ways it can be liberating to drive at Le Mans when you're no longer in it to win it. All the pressure is gone. It's just you and the track and the commitment to go flat out, damn the risks. That's what this middle set of stints felt like. Car was starting to wake up from its slumber during the night, where we seemingly just didn't have the pace of the leading pack due to the lower temperatures. So I was going a good two seconds per lap quicker than in the night. Pietro hammered home that point after me. After going no quicker than a 3:40 minute lap in the night, he set the fastest time of our race with a 3:37.3. That was still a ways off the quickest lap in our class, which was a 3:36.0, set by Robin Frinjs in the #31 WRT, though. Showing that in the race, we just didn't have the ultimate pace. But it was still quick! With three hours to go, I was due to complete my final set of triple stints, but not before Le Mans showed us twice that even if Oliver and Pietro hadn't set a foot wrong, we probably still wouldn't have been able to taste the podium champagne. First we lost eight minutes to an overheating engine issue (which required putting in 4.5L of water that had evaporated!), and just before the end of my runs, we lost half an hour changing a dead starter motor. On the positive side, I banged out my best laps of the race in those final three runs. Managing a satisfying 3:38.9 fastest lap. Cementing a top 40 fastest laps average of 3:41.1. Good enough to be the fifth-fastest silver driver (in a classification stacked with professional drivers half my age!). A small consolation, but a consolation none the less. Such ended my tenth participation in the 100th year of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. With another result far off the potential of the effort. Maybe Le Mans is trying to tell me that I've already had more than my fair share of luck at Circuit de la Sarthe. In the first six attempts, I managed to finish on the podium four times, including winning with Aston Martin in 2014, and gracing the overall podium in 2017. But in the last four attempts, the efforts have been foiled every time by mechanical issues. Blown engines, blown gears, blown starter motor. I'd probably be wise to take the hint and hang it up. But when the pace is still solid (I had over a second on the winning silver driver on the top 40 average fastest laps!), it's hard to commit to calling it quits. We'll see where it goes. But in the meantime, my greatest gratitude to the JOTA team for giving me the best chance at a result since 2017, to my team mates for being gracious with my gentleman-driver ways, and to Le Mans itself for being the greatest motor race in the world.", "date": "2023-06-13T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Kids could bring home a flyer about some future event, they'd get their grades and remarks detailed in a little grey book, and once a year parents would come in for a chat with the teachers. That was basically it, and it was glorious. In Denmark today, we have a centralized app used by all Danish public schools called Aula. Think of it as Facebook for teachers and parents. For our kid in an international school, there's a similar system. All of it sucks. And I don't mean in the way that the apps are poorly made, although that is typically also true, but in the way that adding IT to the parent-school relationship only made it worse. I say that as someone who've spent a long career in the service of collaboration and communication tools. And as someone who is happy to let the kids play video games for hours on end. This is not the luddite perspective. But what these wretched apps have wrought is a constant stream of needless communication and updates about life at school. Worse still, it's facilitated endless threads amongst parents on this thing or the other. And you're essentially obliged to partake in these non-stop chain mails, lest you miss a truly important or urgent message. I simply don't need the play-by-play from a teacher about what happened in class this week, every week. We talk to our kids at home. We'll get the highlights, if there are any worth sharing. Furthermore, it seems that very few people actually like where all this has gone. I've spoken to lots of parents who all begrudge these apps as yet another inbox with an ever-increasing unread counter, and teachers who'd rather spend their time on something else than detailing the mundane updates about weekly school life. Not to mention the fact that teachers often end up inundated with direct messages from parents at a frequency and in tone they'd never have to suffer if it required more effort than a direct message was required to talk. Not all connections benefit from having the friction removed by digital systems. Some barriers to interaction are good, actually. The fundamental premise that everything will be wonderful if we could just all be linked together everywhere, all the time is false. Parents and politicians are all, with some justification, so concerned about the dangers of screens these days. So let's start in our own interactions by burning the most useless use cases right away. We could start with Aula and its ilk.

The rest of the time, across hundreds of reviews, it was an arduous, awkward affair of forcing people to come up with novel ways to congratulate each other on command. Dropping these 360s was perhaps one of the most popular acts of minimizing management we've ever done at It should have been obvious that the 360 process wasn't valuable because almost nobody wanted to do it. Getting folks to fill out their reviews required constant nagging, resulting in weeks-long procrastination. That is not the hallmark of a happy process that serves the interests of the people involved. I think the key reason here is that there is very little upside to rating peers in the totally honest way that might actually be useful as part of a performance review. Even if someone acts in ways you think could be improved, are you really going to complain about it to management? Probably not, unless it's truly egregious, and if so, why wait for the 360? So most people would just keep their minor grievances to themselves, and that's probably for the best! More than once did we deal with unnecessary drama and friction because someone actually did put down some mild feedback, which, as humans are prone to do, was then perceived as a stinging slight. You couldn't design a better process for planting seeds of social dysfunction than to explicitly ask peers to share their minor annoyances with each other through the conduit of management. But so what if 360s are mostly just a compilation of nice things others were forced to say about you on a regular schedule? What's actually wrong with a regular ritual of congratulations? That it's fake, that's what. Humans can smell inauthenticity a mile away. And if 360s are anything, it's inauthentic. A better way of celebrating each other, which is something every company should absolutely seek to do, is to invite the voluntary sharing of authentic admiration in an in-person session dedicated to the point. Without the pretext that it'll come as a sweet'n'sour mix. Just commit to the sweet, and save the sour for a direct managerial conversation in private, if need be. We do this at 37signals during our biyearly meet-ups. We call it peer appreciation, and it's perhaps my favorite part of The contrast between 360s and peer appreciation is clear. Processes that require honest participation need to be seen by the participants as intrinsically valuable. You can't force someone to be honest or authentic, if they don't see a personal upside.

[the remote-work revolution](https://basecamp.com/books/remote)to be effective is that these moments don't need to happen every day, week, or even month.At 37signals, we've been doing company-wide meetups twice a year for over fifteen years. Through these meetups, we've secured the lion's share of the social in-person benefits afforded by an office, while allowing nearly eighty people from twenty countries to collaborate happily and effectively. It's remarkable how nourishing it can be simply to see your coworkers every six months, and then rely on those fully-charged trust batteries to carry you through the interim. Being unable to do this during the pandemic really underscored how critical meetups are to make the whole remote-work arrangement successful. We were deprived meetups for a good two and a half years, and we felt it. But at least we had the recollection of what remote work could be like from the time before the pandemic. Many people got their first experience with remote work during the pandemic, and were deprived of these recharging opportunities, so it's no wonder a fair number of them didn't like it. But how do you actually pull off a successful meetup for a remote company? That's something we've been trying to perfect at 37signals, and, dare I say it, something we've gotten pretty damn good at over the many years. So we thought we'd share our process. In [this video](https://basecamp.com/organizing-a-meet-up), Andrea and Bethany will walk you through how they organized our latest company meetup in New Orleans, using[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/)of course.

The traditional paradigm of a reporting manager that's constantly following up with their reports, conducting daily stand-up meetings, weekly 1-1s, and all other forms of intensive supervision, needs to be (mostly) replaced with an asynchronous, self-managing paradigm instead.

These processes help us dramatically reduce the amount of managerial supervision needed at 37signals. They're the supporting pillars that make the This approach has allowed us to currently just have a single full-time engineering manager across all our programming, operations, and design teams.

None of this is to say that managing people is bad. There are plenty of good reasons for why want to check-in with people directly, to help guide them in their career, to provide redirecting feedback if they're off track. But it is to say that these functions of management can be divorced from much of the other routine supervision work that fills the weeks of a manager under the traditional paradigm. And if you do, you can get away with far fewer full-time managers, allowing individual contributors to flourish as managers of one, as they pursue mastery and autonomy under a shared purpose. Get the processes right and the rest will follow. Let's look at five ways that principle works in practice at 37signals.First, we've replaced the commonly used daily stand-up meetings with a set of automated questions in Basecamp. On Monday mornings, we ask everyone \"What are you going to work on this week?\", and at the end of every day, we ask \"What did you work on today?\". These two recurring questions provide the key process for keeping everyone – not just a manager, but peers and colleagues from other teams as well – in the loop on what someone is working on.Second, we confine the vast majority of product management planning decisions to happen only once every other month. Our Shape Up methodology has us working in 6-week cycles, with 2-week cool-downs. This leaves us with about six cycles per year. Six times where we get to decide \"what should we work on next\". Six times to review the work that was done in the prior cycle.Third, we use Hill Charts in Basecamp to give a bird's eye view of \"where are we with this project\" to anyone who cares to know. This, together with the daily questions, replaces the vast majority of \"will this be shipping soon?\" questions that a manager might be inclined to ask while the work is happening.Fourth, we rely on the bounded autonomy of the 6-week cycle to cap the risk that projects drag on forever. Everyone working on a feature knows that they have to find a way to hammer the scope enough to ship within that maximum budget (and often the budget is shorter still!). This deputizes them to make the necessary trade-offs without the need of a manager.Fifth, we delegate the review of the work of new employees to mentoring peers. This distributes one of the key functions of management, ensuring the quality of the work, amongst the entire team, and keeps it reasonable by only having senior staff serve as mentors for a single mentee. At the same time, we ensure that mentors take this responsibility seriously by putting them on the hook for the quality of the work shipped by the person they're mentoring.

Customer life-time value, cost of acquisition, cohort retention, revenue churn, net promoter score, funnel conversion rates, to name but a few. All useful calculations, but I can't tell you what bliss it's been to steer That's not to say that we never run these numbers, but it is to say that these numbers never run us. Because in the end, even the most sophisticated KPIs all inevitably serve the simplest calculations: Are we making money? Is it enough? You don't need a degree in statistics to determine that. Where this is most evident for us is in the product. I remember reading a story about how Google once tested 127 different shades of blue for some button to see which one did the best. That's the logical, extreme conclusion of being a data-obsessed business, and it sounds beyond dreadful. Half the charm of making something to me is in letting your fingers drive the direction. Without articulation. I've always loved the German word I fully realize what a luxury this is. If you're not yet profitable, it can be instructive to use some of these metrics to pinpoint why (do you have a leaky bucket or is there just not enough flow in the hose?). And if you are profitable, but have investors, many of them will want to know how you might squeeze out even more. Objective metrics help those without insight into the belly of the business benchmark it against others. But where I find folly is in believing that if you don't stress the numbers, you can't expect to see them rise. The greatest myth in management is that you can't manage what you don't measure. It's hot or cold outside regardless of how many digits of precision your thermometer is showing. That is to say all these metrics are downstream from simply making something people want to buy. And keeping your costs below the price you can sell it for. That's the hard part, even if it's a simple calculation. And worse still, if you steer your company according to a constellation of derivative metrics, it's really easy to end up in a swamp. A place where eking out another percentage point or five, to make the next quarter look right, trumps everything else. That's an environment for questionable decisions and short-term thinking. Ultimately, you have to believe that if you're giving it your best, putting bright minds to work on meaningful problems, it's either going to work or it isn't. Rare is the dull business you can turn into a sparkle by obsessing about the derivatives. Common is the dread that's born from trying to do so.

Not because we don't like the service. It's actually really nice! But because the $88,000/year it was going to cost us to continue is just ridiculous. And it's emblematic of a larger issue: Enterprise SaaS pricing is getting silly. But as silly as I thought our bill was going to be, there's a Datadog customer paying $65 million for their services!! This came up on their most recent earnings call. It's apparently a crypto company who 'optimized' their bill by committing to this ludicrous spend: At the risk of invoking a tired cliche, this kind of outlay for a performance and monitoring service sounds like a 0% interest rate phenomenon. There's just no universe I can imagine where that's a reasonable commitment. One that couldn't be more than adequately replaced by open-source alternatives. Even if you needed a fair bit of in-house development on top for tailoring. But I tend to think this way about a lot of enterprisey SaaS software. Like spending $15/month per seat on Salesforce's Slack in a company of 2,000 people comes out at over three hundred grand per year. Just for a chat tool! Now add $30/month per seat for something like Asana. Then $20/month for Dropbox. And just between those three tools, you're up to $65/month per seat at the top levels, or a million and a half in yearly costs for that company of 2,000. Yikes.

It feels like we're in a service bubble waiting to pop. Someone is going to look at those margins and see an opportunity. That's also a key reason we're sticking to our pitch with Basecamp.

Let's be real here. The modern world we live in was designed and executed from an office. It's a perfectly legitimate way of working. It may not be *your*preferred way of working. It sure as hell isn't mine! But let's not make the same mistake of those who couldn't fathom how we at 37signals built a successful, long-term, and prosperous company for twenty years by being remote (that's why we literally wrote a book on the joys of remote working)! The remote workers of the world have already won. There are now endless options to choose from if you want to work from home. Don't spoil that victory by becoming an entitled, totalitarian whiner who won't let some companies make different choices than the one you now happen to like the very best. I salute Apple, for example, for sticking to their in-person culture now that the pandemic is long gone. They're making that choice knowing that some, talented portion of their workforce will leave as a consequence, yet have the confidence that others will fill those chairs. Isn't this what we wanted? The freedom to choose how we'd like to work by picking between a plentitude of companies offering the style of our preference? This is what frustrates me about so many technical and social movements. It's not enough to carve out a clear passing in the forest of options for you and your compatriots to frolic in peace. No, the battle must rage on long after it's won.

Heed the timeless advice of John Gall: blew up the internet yesterday is but the latest illustration.Maybe once you reach the scale of Netflix or Amazon, there are areas where it starts to make sense, but remember that even the likes of GitHub and Shopify run their main applications as monoliths with millions of lines of code and have thousands of programmers collaborating on them. Do you have many more millions of lines of code or thousands of programmers working on the same code bases? If not, exercise extreme caution before even thinking about microservices.But that's advice for folks starting new systems today. What do you do if you already, and prematurely, went with a microservices architecture? How do you recover? Here are a few tips: 1) Stop digging.You can't clean up a mess before you stop making more of it. That means not introducing new microservices. It then means picking one of the existing microservices to be the epicenter that will carry new functionality instead. The gravitational pull of this new center should eventually swallow the majority of other microservices too, but the most important thing to get going is not to make matters worse.2) Consolidate critical, dependent paths first.The worst form of microservice madness is when you splinter a single, coherent flow across multiple systems. Maybe this is signup, maybe this is checkout, maybe this is visiting a single piece of content. That's where microservices cause the most harm by making it cumbersome and error prone to update the entire flow. Making changes means coordinating across multiple systems, dealing with synchronization issues, and worse. So your consolidation of microservices into macroservices on the way back to the monolith should start here.3) Leave isolated performance hotspots for last.When microservices are done right, they often target a narrow, isolated, and usually performance-critical segment of the system, which can benefit from a rewrite in a clunkier but faster programming language. Maybe your entire web application is written in Ruby on Rails, but there's this one screen that can see wild load spikes, and for some reason can't be cached, so you pull out Rust or Go or whatever to squeeze all the juice out of your CPU. Well done, you've microserviced with honors! (Just make sure you've actually done the benchmarking to prove the productivity regression was worth it.)4) Prioritize dropping the most esoteric implementations.One of the terrible side effects of microservice madness is the tendency to embrace a million different programming languages, frameworks, and ecosystems. The siren song of microservices sing tall tales of isolation, which conjure CIO dreams of \"best-in-breed\", and tickle the natural programmer tendency to experiment with new and different as much as possible.But the end result might well be a system comprised of 3-5-7 different programming languages, even more diverse frameworks, and a bunch of parallel dependency tracks. This is murder for conceptual comprehension, and leads to the common microservices symptom of \"nobody understands or can work on the whole system\". Thus, you must start pruning. The vast majority of systems should have no more than two backend languages in play at any one time: A general purpose language tuned for programmer productivity that you can use 99% of the time, and a high-performance language tuned for addressing the last 1% of hotspots, should they ever appear. 5) Learn to partition large systems with modules rather than networks.So much of the motivation for microservices has been driven by the fallacy that if you can't figure out how to properly architect a large system using programming tools like modules and namespaces, then you can solve this problem by partitioning it with network boundaries. No, no, no.Making a large, resilient, performant system is hard. Trying to design one for a novel problem space on day one is impossible. Heed the timeless advice of John Gall: A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. Simplicity demands that you do not start by inviting the beast of complexity – distributed systems – to the first dance. It's possible you'll one day end up with a complex, distributed systems that use microservices with justification, but that will only happen in good conscience if you started with a simple, monolithic design. The key tome to study for how to break down large problem spaces into beautiful domain models is Eric Evan's Domain-Driven Design. But you should only graduate to that level of strategic, architectural aspirations after you've mastered the basics of tactical programming through books like Kent Beck's Smalltalk Best Practices(if you work in object-orientated languages) and Martin Fowler's Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. Our industry is full of bright, passionate people. Many of them eager to start an Iron Man before they've done a 5K run. As much as I admire the gumption and self-confidence, and don't believe as a general rule in learning speed limits, I also think we've done the lot of them a disservice by not being clearer about the dangers of microservices earlier. But that's the great thing about learning: You can always start! And if learning something new makes you reflect differently on the choices you made before, then you can change your approach from this day forth. Yes, microservices, like any pattern of programming, is a tool. Yes, \"it depends\" is technically correct. But we offer no guidance to those looking to design better systems by simply saying that; we need to be willing to say WHAT IT DEPENDS ON. Just saying \"it depends\" helps nobody, anywhere make better decisions. So let's be clear. Using microservices well usually depends on: a) Having a large, complex system that has successfully evolved from a small, simple system. b) The ability to identify a part of this clearly modularized design that has strong boundaries, and no critical-flow dependencies, as a candidate for extraction.Then only proceeding IF there are large performance gains to be had by switching implementation approach OR there are organizational benefits from placing the module with an entire team, which can't easily collaborate with the rest of the system makers. You might well find other justifications within your system or organization, but they should be clearly articulated, rigorously examined, and critically challenged before embarking on microservices. Or, you know, you can just YOLO, have fun needlessly splintering your system design into dozens of pieces, and then return to this guide when the hangover hurts enough.

This move saved them a staggering 90%(!!) on operating costs, and simplified the system too. What a win!But beyond celebrating their good sense, I think there's a bigger point here that applies to our entire industry. Here's the telling bit: \"We designed our initial solution as a distributed system using serverless components... In theory, this would allow us to scale each service component independently. However, the way we used some components caused us to hit a hard scaling limit at around 5% of the expected load.\" That really sums up so much of the microservices craze that was tearing through the tech industry for a while: IN THEORY. Now the real-world results of all this theory are finally in, and it's clear that in practice, microservices pose perhaps the biggest siren song for needlessly complicating your system. And serverless only makes it worse. What makes this story unique is that Amazon was the original poster child for service-oriented architectures. The far more reasonable prior to microservices. An organizational pattern for dealing with intra-company communication at crazy scale when API calls beat scheduling coordination meetings. SOA makes perfect sense at the scale of Amazon. No single team could ever hope to know or understand everything needed to steer such a fleet of supertankers. Making teams coordinate via published APIs was a stroke of genius. But, as with many good ideas, this pattern turned toxic as soon as it was adopted outside its original context, and wreaked havoc once it got pushed into the internals of single-application architectures. That's how we got microservices. In many ways, microservices is a zombie architecture. Another strain of an intellectual contagion that just refuses to die. It's been eating brains since the dark days of J2EE (remote server beans, anyone??) through the [WS-Deathstar](https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/1428661128/)nonsense, and now in the form of microservices and serverless. But this third wave seems finally to have crested. I wrote an ode to [The Majestic Monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/)way back in 2016. Kelsey Hightower, one of the leading voices behind Kubernetes, [put it beautifully in 2020](https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future): \"We’re gonna break [the monolith] up and somehow find the engineering discipline we never had in the first place... Now you went from writing bad code to building bad infrastructure. Because it drives a lot of new spend, it drives a lot of new hiring… So a lot of people get addicted to all the flourishment of money, and marketing, and it’s just a lot of buzz that people are attaching their assignment to, when honestly it’s not gonna necessarily solve their problem.\" Bingo. Replacing method calls and module separations with network invocations and service partitioning within a single, coherent team and application is madness in almost all cases. I'm happy that we beat back the zombie onslaught of that terrible idea for the third time in my living memory, but we still need to stay vigilant that we'll eventually have to do it again. Some bad ideas simply refuse to die no matter how many times you kill them. All you can do is recognize when they rise from the dead once more, and keep your retorical shotgun locked and loaded.", "date": "2023-05-04T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

This is the original app that started it all for us from way back in 2004. And now, after a couple of years running on AWS, it's back on our own hardware, using Kamal, and holy smokes is it fast! Just look at these charts: The median request now runs in just 19ms, compared to 67ms before. The mean request in 95ms vs 138ms. The median query time has dropped in half (which adds up when you do a lot of queries per request!). Basecamp Classic was no slouch in the cloud before, but now 95% of all requests are below that magic 300ms cut-off. (But take these comparisons with a pound of salt. It's not exactly a clean-room, scientific test. Just a peak at the reality of leaving a fine-tuned cloud setup for a fully-owned hardware alternative.) Basecamp Classic ran on EKS in AWS (that's their managed Kubernetes setup) using a mix of c5.xlarge and c5.2xlarge instances for the application itself. The databases were running on db.r4.2xlarge and db.r4.xlarge instances via RDS. Now home, we're running on Dell R7625's with dual AMD EPYC 9454 CPUs. This new home setup was specced with the same number of vCPUs as we ran in the cloud using KVM, so about 122 for the application and jobs. But looking at our load levels, we can probably shrink that a fair bit, and still keep these excellent performance figures. In fact, given that each of our new Dell R7625s have 196 vCPUs, we could actually run the entire Basecamp Classic application, including databases and Redis, on a single such machine! That's just astounding. Of course, you wouldn't actually do that for redundancy reasons, but it's a testament to the fact that hardware is fun again and that we've come full circle. Basecamp launched in 2004 on a single machine (with 1 vCPU!) and can now, in 2023, run on a single machine again. Each of these machines were less than $20,000. Amortize that over five years. That's $333/month for all the hardware (minus routers etc) needed to run Basecamp Classic today. And this is still a large SaaS app that's generating literally millions of dollars in revenue per year! The vast majority of SaaS businesses out there would require far less firepower to service their customers. Now, we didn't pin our cloud exit strategy on increasing performance, but it's nice to see that it did anyway. Especially since Basecamp Classic, this twenty-year old OG of our business, is still serving a large, loyal, and satisfied customer base that haven't received any new features in over a decade. But hey, speed is a feature too, so I guess you could say we just shipped one! Next up on the cloud exit schedule is the big one: HEY! Stay tuned.", "date": "2023-05-02T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Becoming a person whose presence and competence benefits others. For both your sake and theirs. Jordan Peterson calls this the \"meaningful burden\" in There's something inherently counterintuitive about this notion that people who feel overwhelmed by life, or lost in its endless possibilities, might not need a lighter load, but a more meaningful burden instead. It reminds me of the version of burnout that stems not from overwork, but from under-purpose. Sometimes, the answer to \"it's just all too much\" is, weirdly, \"can I have some more, please\". Denmark's strong culture of clubs and associations, in which 9/10 Danes belong to some form of one or the other, is an example of this. All of these clubs and associations are built primarily on volunteer efforts. People choosing to spend their evenings, weekends, or vacations on organizing and participating in cinema groups, handball leagues, trading-card circles, and a million other things. Not just because they really like films or handball or trading cards, but also because they like the responsibility that comes with being an organizer of such efforts. I've spent the last twenty-plus years finding such purpose in open-source development. Becoming a person whose presence and competence benefits others through the sharing of free software and ideas. And I've seen countless others do it too. But I've also seen people become upset about this concept that the responsibility is the reward in itself when it comes to open source software. That there's something inherently unfair or exploitive about people choosing to spend their free time, without recompense, on advancing projects that might commercially benefit others. The whole \"unpair labor\" theory of contributions. But the more I think of it, and Some people are lucky to find a full serving of purpose at home or at work. But many more need to find it in a third place. A place where the responsibility is the reward. This should be encouraged and commended. Jordan Peterson calls this the \"meaningful burden\" in 12 Rules for Life, and downright posits it as an antidote to depression.

From deaths of despair, soaring crime in some cities, ballooning debts, dysfunctional politics, and a raging culture war. It's easy to be down on those United States. Too easy, in fact. Take gun deaths, for example. Americans own more guns per capita than any other country in the world, and by a huge margin too. Those guns are used by people to kill others and themselves. But while the homicide rate is up recently, it's still below where it was in the 90s or even the 70s. Suicides by gun haven't really swung that much either. Is this a great place to be? No. Is it some historical new peak? No. Have past peaks come down? Yes. America is a violent country. It's been a violent country for a long time. This is not a novel situation. But it's also true that median incomes in the US have risen faster than comparable economies. Here's The Economist making the comparison to the UK: \"Britons, some of Europe’s best-off inhabitants, spent 80% as much as Americans in 1990. By 2021 that was down to 69%.\" On purely median-income terms, all boats are rising in the US, even if the biggest boats are rising faster. The Economist points to America's increasing rates of productivity to explain the progress, and that does ring true (just measure how long it takes to get a rental car in the US vs in Europe for one vivid illustration!). And a recent article in The Atlantic did an excellent job of dispelling the myth that Millennials have been uniquely screwed compared to past generations. Not only are Millennial median incomes significantly above past generations in constant dollars at the same time, home ownership is basically the same (48% vs 50%), and even wealth accumulation is largely on track. It's not all roses and sunshine, of course. There are important regressions, particularly for men without a college degree. (Meanwhile, Millenial women are up 20% over their Gen X peers and double up(!) over their boomer peers!). But the picture is far from this universally grim portrait of a generation lost. I sense the folly of all of this disproportionate gloom even more vividly now, having lived in Denmark for much of the past three years. Denmark really does have an incredible number of good fortunes going for it. Copenhagen is the safest major city in the world, we have government-funded education and healthcare, and high trust in politicians, the media, and fellow citizens. There's a lot to love! And yet, I think many middle-class Americans would chafe at a trade. Plenty of Danes, especially in the larger cities, live in comparably small apartments, wash their clothes in common areas in the basement, don't own a car, and contend themselves with long waits for many forms of medical care. The average Dane pays about a third of their earnings in income taxes, too, and another quarter when they spend the money left over on purchases (VAT). Again, I think the Danish setup is working very well for the Danes. But I also think some Americans have a tendency to romanticize the Nordics. And to think all that's needed to turn the US into a similar society is just to tax some billionaires more. That's just nonsense. Not just because of the diversity and inherent individualism of American society, but also because the numbers just don't add up, and because plenty of Americans would reject the broad taxes and other material sacrifices that would come with the trade. There are a million other angles you could look at the reason for this American malaise. Plenty of data points that would prove your thesis that it's all going to hell in a handbasket. But if you allow yourself to zoom out a bit, look at the long historical trends, you might just find that things aren't actually as dire as the constant feed of dystopian headlines would lead you to believe. America is in a funk right now, there's no doubt about it. Some of that funk is rooted in real, novel, and difficult dilemmas and regressions. But plenty of it also just stems from the general vibe that things are terrible because they feel terrible. And that's the part that seems self-inflicted, unnecessary, and correctable. America needs to get its mojo back. Its self-confidence. Not the starry-eyed, see-no-evil-hear-no-evil kind, but the realistic kind. The kind that's proud of its incredibly dynamic economy, world-class innovations, agile companies, entrepreneurial spirit, melting-pot achievements, and charter of progress. Not only does America itself depend on that, but these little fairy-tale societies in the Nordics do too. Despite all its flaws, I don't actually want to see where the world might go if a strong America is replaced on the world scene by the current prospective alternatives. It took a break from being in the thick of it to realize that, yes, I am actually on Team America. Proudly so.

I'd probably still wager that the fears are overstated – that we also got prematurely euphoric about the imminent prospects of self-driving cars – and that AI generating code is different from it evolving existing systems. But I wouldn't want to bet the house on it. This might just be The Big One. That uncertainty, whether we truly are on the cusp of a total transformation, is a surprising novelty to me, despite thirty years in software. We've been through so many breathless predictions about how this or that advancement in software would simply \"Change. Everything. Forever.\" that a certain pessimism would be perfectly reasonable. I've seen, for example, at least three hype cycles of No Code movements come and go over those thirty years, and none of them ever fulfilled their grand promises. Even the two properly big transformations we've had in that time, the internet and mobile, havn't made the kind of programming most people do today look all that different from the kind of programming done in the 90s. So on the one hand you'd be wise to keep skepticism by your side, as the world hurls itself toward the summit of AI infatuation. And on the other, you'd also do well to practice the negative visualization of a world where the hype is real. Maybe we have finally reached the beginning of the end for software development as we formerly knew it. The purpose of such visualization is not to descend into the catacombs of professional nihilism. That nothing we do now matters, because the coming AI overlords will relieve us of our duties in a moment anyway. But to muster the humility to accept that, yes, occasionally, if rarely, the world really does change dramatically. And there's nothing to be gained from nurturing existential fears of what you cannot change. I like to imagine that all of us in software development, as it looks today, are busy making beautiful kerosene lamps in all shapes and sizes. We're improving the burn efficiency. We're finding ever clearer forms of glass to let the light through. We're tinkering with a formula that's been around for a long time. But as we do, Edison and Tesla are busy inventing electricity in the other room. I'm sure it wasn't clear at all, even to Edison and Tesla, when exactly the switch would be flipped on that final lightbulb moment. And meanwhile, the world still needed to see in the dark, so the lamps of old were still necessary. That just might be us, right now, lighting the path to the future with the ways of what could soon be the past. That's a beautiful mission. Even if it's a one-way ticket. We had to come.

And since we're fighting competitors with one hand behind our back by refusing to use privacy-invasive ads targeted on personal data, we thought it was worth trying some more conventional channels, like billboards. But at least for software like Basecamp, it's clear that isn't likely to work. It's not that it did *nothing*. We did have 98 billboards all over Boston for about a month. But the effect was only barely measurable: ![boston-metrics.png](https://world.hey.com/dhh/2ae8c9dd/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHNLd2ZkVkdGRyIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--cf64ee3bc71e1c32311800a931eedf2a811694f6/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--946116ea0c454412635aa7309bd9472bf633014c/boston-metrics.png) As you can see, we were at the top end of the predicted normal range, or even slightly above. But even with that, we ended up spending thousands of dollars on every attributable trial signup. Way outside the realm of anything we could claim a return on, even if you factored in a fair bit of long-run brand awareness. I will say that it *felt*pretty cool to see the irreverent Basecamp marketing messages appear on building-hugging billboards. There was an emotionally gratifying return on the investment. And perhaps that explains why it used to be common to see business software advertised in places like San Francisco where a lot of executives of such companies could feel good about seeing them. There's something gratifying about being in the real world like this. But yeah, it didn't work. We won't be doing that again.

This 650-attendee conference will kick off the worldwide ambitions for The Rails Foundation to host a new series of ecosystem gatherings at incredibly affordable prices (this first effort will be just €199-€299 for a ticket!). Way to make an entrance! This new conference will kick off at quite a momentous occasion, too: Celebrating the 20th anniversary of Ruby on Rails! I started working on the framework in the summer of 2003 as part of the development of Basecamp. By October, the framework had a shape that would be completely recognizable today, with Active Record and Action Pack in place. It's thus also fitting that we celebrate this anniversary on the old continent, since I wrote Rails a mere 800 km away from Amsterdam in Copenhagen, Denmark. But of course we also have our eyes set on taking Rails World to the new world in the future. It was in America that Ruby on Rails really took off, and where so many of the instrumental companies in our ecosystem reside. It's that treasure chest, and the commitment to an ongoing budget, that's making employing Amanda as a full-time executive director and underwriting Rails World at such an accessible price possible. Huge thanks to these founding eight companies for their involvement. This is what believing in a bright future for Ruby on Rails looks like at the corporate level. I'm personally also ever so keen to share my enthusiasm for Rails with attendees in Amsterdam this October. It never ceases to amaze me how much momentum, excitement, and passion we've been able to sustain for now two decades. I used to think the day would come when we'd just be 'done', but I've surrendered to the notion that Ruby on Rails can always improve on its mission to be a full-stack framework. The web continues to evolve, and Rails will continue to evolve with it. It's also just fun to use a major conference as the occasion to present new work again. We've been working on a bunch of novel frameworks and libraries at 37signals recently. Some that have already premiered, like Kamal, and others we haven't even talked about in public yet. Come Rails World, I'll make sure we show all our cards. I also look forward to working with Amanda and the rest of the program committee to cherrypick the very best presentations for what programmers looking to break into Rails or level up their skills ought to know about. From Propshaft to Zeitwerk to Hotwire to Kamal to the stables of Rails 7.1 (and perhaps a Rails 8 preview!).

I vaguely remember doing a tour of our Chicago data center over a decade ago, but somewhere along the line, I just lost interest in the iron itself. Now the interest is back, because hardware is fun again, so let me share my excitement with you! These are the two pallets that showed up in our Chicago data center recently. The same day that an identical set arrived in Ashburn, Virginia for our second data center. In total, we received twenty R7625 Dell servers that'll power the bulk of our cloud exit. It's a staggering amount of computing power in a shockingly small footprint. Here's a diagram of our four cabinets in Chicago (we have another four in Ashburn). As you can tell, there's still a bunch of older hardware dedicated to Basecamp in particular. A good chunk of that will actually get retired, once we're done setting things up. But all the 2U servers marked 'kvm' at the bottom of the cabinets are the new ones: You can spot the new R7625s at the bottom of the actual racks here, next to the older gear: Each of these R7625s contain two AMD EPYC 9454 CPUs running at 2.75GHz with 48 cores / 96 threads. That means we're adding almost 4,000 vCPUs to our on-premise fleet! And a ridiculous 7,680 GB of RAM! And 384TB of Gen 4 NVMe storage! Serious horsepower and headroom for years to come. In addition to this, we have another ~six database servers showing up between now and this summer, and then we'll be set. The contrast to the origin of Basecamp is funny. We launched Basecamp on a single-core Celeron server with just 256MB of RAM back in 2004. Spinning rust at 7,200 RPM. And that was good enough to get the business from part-time to full-time in about a year. Almost twenty years later, we now have a long lineage of legacy applications (because we promise to keep applications customers depend on running until the end of the internet!), some massive flagship services in Basecamp and HEY, and a mission to get it all running on hardware we own ourselves again. It's kinda wild to think that it's been less than three months since we decided to scrap Kubernetes and pursue a simpler solution for the cloud exit with Kamal. And that we've already moved half of the cloud applications that need to come home! Over the next month or so, we plan to bring home both Basecamp Classic (still a multi-million dollar business, even if it hasn't been updated in about 13 years – that SaaS magic!), as well as the grand prize of the cloud exit: HEY! That'll leave us with just Highrise and a small auxiliary service called Portfolio left in the cloud as we start the month of May. I thought we were already being optimistic when we planned a total cloud exit by the end of summer, but now it seems we'll basically be done by the end of spring instead. Truly a remarkable achievement by the team working on this effort. The reality of our accelerated timeline has made me even more bullish on cloud exits in general. I imagined getting out of the cloud was going to be as hard as getting in. But that just hasn't proven to be the case. Though perhaps it's helped that we've had that nuts number of $38,000/week in cloud spend as a motivating carrot to get it done quickly! I seriously hope that other SaaS entrepreneurs looking at their daunting cloud bills are paying attention. Once you've gone cloud, it might seem impossible to contemplate getting out again, but don't believe that for a second. Modern server hardware is incredible. We've taken huge leaps forward in performance, density, and cost over the last few years. If you haven't run the numbers since cloud became the default in the past decade, you really ought to do so now. The numbers might just shock you as much as they did us. So the end is now clearly in sight. We've solved all the key technical challenges we needed to address to make the cloud exit happen. We've been running production apps on Kamal for a while now. The path is clear, and I can't wait for those mammoth cloud bills evaporate. I think we're going to find that the napkin math I did for our public calculation of savings will be highly conservative.

It breaks down the history of first how the Republican party got overrun by low-rung thinking from the mid-90s forward, then how equally low-rung thinking got the other side in the past decade or so. It's a light, humorous recap of modern American political history. I highly recommend it. It's central contribution is adding a second dimension to the political spectrum. What we're dealing with is not just far-left, left, center, right, far-right. That spectrum is about contesting 'what is' and 'what ought to be'. Our current problem is not so much disagreeing about those two central elements. All democracies will and should continue to do that. It's how that disagreements manifest themselves in political tactics. Especially the concept of idea supremacy: Yeah, that about sums it up. Which is what Urban does so well in this book, sums it up. Not just concepts like idea supremacy, high-rung vs low-rung thinking, ideological golems vs intellectual genies, or the Liberal Games vs the Power games. He also sums up the feeling of having been made politically homeless, as a long-term, progressive-leaning individual, once the low-rung thinking of the woke nonsense conquered one important institution after another. In this effort, Urban shares a lot of his analysis with the likes of John McWhorter, whose book Woke Racism also came from the perspective of a progressive dismayed by what he saw his 'own side' turn into. But Urban zooms further out. Trying to analyze not just a particular dysfunction, such as a woke nonsense, but all forms of nonsense that occurs once our baser instincts take over. So I think it might be easier for progressives sitting on the fence, not sure what to think about the woke nonsense, to consider Urban's analysis. It's less testy out the gate. It starts with an account of 'the other side started it'. The mood is lighter, at least in the beginning, and the drawings are funny. So by the time you get to the serious critique, your progressive guards might just have been lowered enough to consider the claims with an open mind. In the end, What's our problem? ends with the same prescription as Woke Racism, though. We have to stand up to the ideological golems in order to rescue our political discourse. To reject the echo chambers and get back to the idea labs, as Urban puts it. Refuse to let idea supremacy cow us into submission. As someone who's gone through it, I can tell you that it's easier said than done. But I also believe that the tide indeed is turning. It's far easier to stand up to the golems today than it was a couple of years ago. At least in the realm of business. (Things still look pretty rough in academia!). That's progress. I think we've seen the darkest days of this. Or maybe that's just my optimistic streak wishing that to be true. But I would love to return to the idea lab. Argue positions for the intellectual sport and societal enlightenment again. Without everything turning into this cliché: Kudos to Urban for his broad, persuasive call for us all to do the same.

This in contrast to trying to catch every task the moment it lands from the myriad of interruption pipes that'll drip-drip-drip your day away if you let them. Nowhere is this more evident than with email. I used to take such pride in inbox zero when I was still using Gmail. I'd check email continuously throughout the day, and I'd get back to almost everyone immediately. Whether it was urgent or not. Just so I could see that sweet zero. It felt very productive. It was not. Every email is a drop, and every drop ripples the surface of your mind. It's careless to let them hit without a filter. Your attention will have a hard time finding a still moment to focus like that. This is what being busy often feels like. Like drops pelleting your brain with tasks from a dozen sources at once. Thus leaving you entirely incapable of finding the flow that'll actually take you somewhere. So many movements, so little progress. Rejecting this way of working is why I usually feel very content about the progress I'm able to make on the things that matter, without feeling overwhelmed or busy all the time. Because it really just isn't that busy most of the time! It's focused, sure. But not busy. Again, let's look at email. I use HEY's Focus & Reply feature to get back to people who don't need an urgent reply (which is almost everyone). I let the bucket fill up with 30-40-50 emails over a week or two, then I knock out replies to all of them in less than an hour. Just make that contrast. Letting your attention be disturbed 30-40-50 times over a week or two vs accepting a single interruption in the form of a focused hour. It's a monumental difference. I do the same with GitHub issues for the many open source projects I'm involved in. They'll accumulate for weeks in the notifications box, and then I'll take the time to clear it all out at once every now and then. This is key to avoiding maintainer's fatigue. I'm happy to look at your suggestion or your feedback, but I'll do it on my own schedule, thank you very much. Same too at work. I don't spend, say, every week reviewing our expenses. But I do like to be up to speed on where the money goes. So maybe once a month or once a quarter, I'll do a deep dive, kick off a handful of inquiries on how we ought to save on the frivolous, and then forget all about expenses until next time. This is an intentional and sequential way to live and work. Too many people delude themselves into thinking they can parallelize a million things at once, but they can't. Multitasking is a mirage.

Getting to profitability is no longer a distant, post-IPO nice-to-have, but a short-term necessity for survival. But how to do that without cutting off the legs of the product team? By using better tools and techniques. 1: Unless market conditions demand otherwise, delay native app development for as long as possible. It's amazing what you can do with the mobile web today. We're even getting native notifications on iOS shortly! But it's not perfect. We wouldn't have a chance to compete in, say, personal email with HEY without a killer native app. But some B2B operation that's mainly used by folks sitting in front of computers at their desk? Delay the native aspirations. 2: Hire full-stack developers, and don't let them split the frontend and backend into separate jurisdictions. The same person has to be capable of taking an idea to production entirely on their own. If they can't, your setup is too complicated, and you need to simplify. This often comes up with teams that have ended up in React land or similar. Now there's React, then maybe GraphQL, with separate setups, build tools, and yikes. This one isn't a quick fix, and some times it just can't be fixed, but you can rescue something from the situation by at least having single full-stack developers in charge of everything. 3: Hire designers who work natively with the web. If your designers are stuck in Figma or Photoshop, and are unable to turn drawings into HTML and CSS, they're going to be a major drag on your productivity. Designers need to know the materials they're working with, and capable of molding them independently. They also need to be the ones driving the decisions around how the pitch is turning into the working feature. We've been running on these principles since inception at 37signals. That's how we've built everything from Basecamp to HEY. We have tiny product teams – almost every feature you see in either product was built for the web with just 1 programmer + 1 designer – and they work on with a full stack consisting of Ruby on Rails and Hotwire. It almost feels like we're cheating when I talk to other shops and hear about how big the teams need to be in order to ship. How much specialization has crept into the process. So many hats, so many people, so many tools. But during the go-go days, it just didn't matter. But these ain't the go-go days no more. If you're a SaaS entrepreneur, now is a good time to do a service check on your product team productivity. What would it do for your prospects if you could ship more, and faster, with fewer folks? Have you just followed trends blindly because that's what worked for Facebook or Google? It's easier to turn the ship around before you're in the middle of the storm. Right now it's just raining.

We already run Basecamp on our own hardware, but we deploy it using an old tool known as Capistrano. This is the deployment tool we originally wrote at 37signals all the way back in 2005, when we first had to deploy applications to multiple servers. It's been a trusty companion for many years, but it's time is up, and the game has moved on. Enter Kamal! Kamal marries the procedural simplicity of Capistrano with the advantages of modern containerization techniques. It sits on top of basic Docker, and harvests all the benefits you get from isolated containers with a sliver of the complexity associated with most other solutions. Instead of sending the deployment pipeline off to servers in the cloud, it runs entirely on your own machine. Just like Capistrano did. This makes Kamal really fast. Our sophisticated, Kubernetes backed deployment pipeline for HEY often takes minutes to deploy a new version. Depending on how the underlying images are cached, it can take even longer than that. We've put a fair amount of effort into speeding things up with all sorts of sophisticated techniques, but that's still where we are. With Kamal, we can deploy a new version of HEY in as little as 20 seconds. But speed is just one factor. The bigger factor, and the reason we wrote Kamal, is because it allows us to use the cloud advantages of containerization on our own bare-metal hardware. There are also just way fewer moving parts. Illustrated here by the +/- on lines of configuration and code with the Kamal pull request for Writeboard: Ironically, Kamal is also a great option, even if you're running in the cloud! It makes your entire system setup vendor independent in a way we never managed to truly achieve with Kubernetes. This is still beta software. Yes, we're using it in production already, but I'm sure some elements will still move around on the way to v1.0. Which we intend to release in celebration of the last application leaving the cloud at 37signals sometime this summer. So if you're the adventurous kind, please do jump in, help develop Kamal on its way to a stable release.

Oh, and masks apparently did little to nothing to stop community spread.

As late as early 2022, when Denmark dumped all restrictions of all kinds, there were experts proclaiming what a reckless, if not genocidal, strategy that was. But it wasn't. Denmark has enjoyed total freedom from covid restrictions ever since. There was no surge in hospitalizations. These prophesies failed too. Let's not even get started on the folly of Russiagate. The point isn't that one side has had a particularly cold streak of prophesies for the past several years, but that all people on all sides are likely and liable to get it wrong on the big questions of the day. Yes, it might be frustrating that there seemingly are zero ramifications for journalists and pundits flopping it repeatedly, but use that frustration to look inward. When all these highly-credentialed people can get it so wrong for so long, what dearly-held beliefs might you sit with that aren't so? We're living through an era of turmoil. A fourth turning. So if you're going to put on a mask, make it one that delivers a steady flow of humility. Then use that clear head to temper all these ill-conceived attempts to rid the internet of misinformation, disinformation, or whatever label people intent on silencing their political opponents is using these days.

Not getting the savings you thought you would with the cloud? It's because you didn't go serverless. Frustrated with the complexity of the cloud? Serverless! Performance questions? SERVERLESS! Serverless has become a mantra to chant because it's still appears just magic enough that most people won't question the fundamentals. But you should. Let's start at the beginning. Clouds, and VPS's before that, work on the age-old principle of buying in bulk and selling by the piece. You run one big server for $1,000/month, then you rent it out to seven people for $200/month, and voila, you've cleared a $400/month profit. That actually works well for all parties, if the seven customers aren't too taxing on the equipment or if they tax it at different times. The customers get to skip the capital outlay for the server plus get the compute they require, when they require it. This is the ideal cloud scenario. But what happens if a customer needs the performance of a whole box, most of the time? Then they're paying $1,400/month for $1,000's worth of computing. Or maybe, because they're reserving the whole box, they'll get a deal at $1,250/month by committing to a whole year. That deal is far less obviously good on both sides. It's basically a credit agreement at a 25% APR. Tread wisely! Enter serverless. It's the same financial mechanics as above, but you can slice the server far more thinly. Instead of renting out your one big server to seven customers at $200/month, you rent out individual function executions to 100 customers at $20/month. This now clears $1,000/month in profit instead of just $400/month. No wonder cloud providers love serverless! Again, if you only need a few functions executed every now and then, this works out for you as a customer too (at least in the short term). But if you execute enough functions to fill the computing power of a whole box, it's a terrible deal. Not just because you'll be paying more for the same clock cycles, but also because the lock-in is immense. The further down the rabbit hole you go with \"cloud-native\" services in serverless, the harder it'll be to climb out when you realize that you should own the donkey rather than rent it. And especially once you realize that paying to rent a whole donkey at the piece price of a hundred slices is an even worse deal than just renting the whole donkey by itself! Don't be fooled by serverless. There's no magic that can change the fundamental fact that if you need all the computing cycles of a computer, you ought to own that computer. And if you start off with a proprietary serverless setup, you might well find the lock-in impossible to escape by the time the rental math no longer works. The cloud is primarily for companies that have big swings in use – like Amazon's original AWS case of huge demand around Black Friday and Christmas, which left them with unused capacity for the rest of the year – or for early outfits that don't do enough business to either warrant owning a whole computer or spend so little on the cloud that it just doesn't matter.

The unlimited upside! Growth cures all! The next digit unlocks the next round! Don't get me wrong, without revenue, without paying customers, there's nothing. But once there's something, costs count just as well to the bottom line as does revenue – if you care about profits, and you should. Profits equal independence, sustainability, and, ultimately, prosperity. But costs aren't just about the bottomline, they're also a measure of efficiency. I have a distinct distaste for waste. Money spent on the frivolous or the ill-considered is money that can't be spent elsewhere. Like an engine drinking too much oil just to run. Tight tolerances (but not too tight!) are a joy in themselves. I think part of the reason many entrepreneurs have a strained relationship with cost control is that they've seen what happens when you leave it to the bean counters. And many companies do. Cost hammering left entirely to folks who like spreadsheets a little too much is a dangerous recipe. Cost needs to be everyone's concern. That doesn't mean haggling with employees over purchases they need to do their job. That's moronic. I once had to spend several days navigating the expense maze at a company to buy a $35 book. It must have cost the company hundreds if not thousands of dollars in lost attention and motivation. That's not cost control, that's cost myopia. It does mean going through every large line item with regularity and asking yourself \"is this really worth it?\". It's so easy to let costs slip, and suddenly you're looking at a disturbingly large monthly nut, thinking what the hell? This counts triple if you're a startup, not yet firmly settled in profitability. At 37signals, we celebrate cutting costs on everything but people and their wellbeing. Don't spend money on vendors that you could spend on employees. Vote with your dollars for a lean ship that can sail for as long as it pleases.

A place for commerce and more that's not owned by any one company, any one country. Free trade and free expression on a scale never known to humans before. We will not contribute to the erosion of those ideals by voting with our dollars for further consolidation of the servers that run this beautiful free haven into the hands of a few hyperscalers. We spend our money wisely. The cost of cloud is grotesque in several key instances. Whether it's big-iron databases, large NVMe storage, or just the latest, fastest compute, we're paying as much to rent the donkey every few months as it would cost to buy it. When that's the case, you should own the donkey! We will spend our money on our own hardware and our own people. Everything else will get the squeeze. We lead the way. Cloud has been sold as The Answer to SaaS companies like ours for a decade or more. I bought the narrative. We bought the narrative. The narrative is not true. Cloud has its place, and we used it well with the launch of HEY, for example, but that place is a minority perch. Most SaaS business of our size and above should be owning their infrastructure rather than renting it. We will pave the path ideologically and technologically for others to follow that conclusion. We seek adventure. \"Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work\" -- Daniel Burnham.

We need to add about 2,000 vCPU per data center, and we run in two data centers, so 4,000 vCPUs for performance and redundancy. All rough numbers. Spending $600,000 on a bunch of hardware might sound like a lot in the age of cloud. But if you amortize that over a conservative five years, it's just $120,000 per year! And we have lots of boxes still running at seven years. But that's of course just the boxes. They also have to be connected to power and bandwidth. We currently spend about $60,000/month on eight dedicated racks between our two data centers through Deft. That's a total of $840,000/year for everything. Bandwidth, power, and boxes on an amortization schedule of five years. Compared to $2.3m in the cloud.

He's an anti-influencer in a car world dominated by slick, status-conscious performers on YouTube. A reminder that being into cars doesn't have to be about showing off, and that you can enjoy the design, engineering, and driving experience of these wonderful machines entirely on their own merits. Doug's over-the-top yet authentic enthusiasm is backed up by a real knack for dissecting the QUIRKS & FEATURES of cars under his review. He brings you along for a journey of incredulity every time he marvels at the design of a vanity mirror, door latch, or design insignia placed in an odd location. He helps you develop an eye and an articulation of why it is that being into cars is such fun. The variety, the origin stereotypes, the often curious trade-offs that has to be made when putting 5,000+ parts together for a modern car. I've enjoyed Doug's show for years, but it was a video he posted about his All-Time Dream Car that really inspired me. Doug's favorite car is the Porsche Carrera GT. It's the genesis of his entire career in automotive journalism, and he's been pining for that grail car since 2005. Now, thanks to his incredible YouTube success, which he has parlayed into a car auction website that recently received a large investment, he's been able to buy his own Carrera GT. And I've probably never been more pleased by proxy of someone else's fulfilment of their car dream than when I was watching that celebration video. Because it reminded me of all the reasons that I'm into cars. The child-like awe I feel every time I see a cool car coming in the opposite direction. There's just this deep sense of wonder that's triggered by the shapes and sounds of great MACCHINA (the Italian word for car, which you should always imagine in your head spoken with the intensity of an excited Italian!). I refuse to give up that affection, despite all the many ways it's possible to PROBLEMATIZE cars today. We can argue the virtues of public transit, bikes, or pollution-free inner cities, and still let out a shriek of COUNTACH! when a bright yellow Lamborghini passes us by. Life is full of contradiction, and the heart beats for passion before reason. No apologies needed. Which finally brings me to the story of MY ALL-TIME DREAM CAR: The Pagani Zonda. I first saw the Zonda on Top Gear in 2004, just a few years after it had premiered at the Geneva Autoshow. Richard Hammond's gushing review of the car might not have been in the style of Doug DeMuro, but it had that same infectious enthusiasm. I remember thinking at the time: If I ever truly make it, this will be my car. Note, this was the same year Basecamp and Ruby on Rails came into the world. From a small apartment in Copenhagen – before I even had a driver's license! – and with no fortune to my name. Which is exactly the kind of impossible dream that bedroom posters of cool cars have permitted since the supercar was invented by Ferruccio Lamborghini with the Miura. Fast forward six years to 2010. Jason and I had made some real money selling software (and a small stake in the company to Jeff Bezos!), and I went on a three-week trip with my wife-to-be around Europe in a white Lamborghini. We started in the UK, and ended up covering some 6,000 kilometers on that trip. Truly an epic journey through the Alps, on the Autobahn (first time I ever hit 200mph on public road!), and to the magical towns of Modena and Sant'Agata in Italy. The itinerary had included a visit to the Lamborghini factory from the start. There we had the honor of meeting and lunching with the legendary Lamborghini test driver, Valentino Balboni, who, when we met him in 2010 just before his retirement, had been working for the company since 1968! He had just been immortalized with his own special edition of the Gallardo, the LP 550-2 Valentino Balboni. The first rear-wheel driven Lamborghini of the modern era. This is us posing with him in front of that car: Now this is where things could so easily have gone a different way, and I would have missed out on owning my all-time dream car forever. Because after visiting the Lamborghini factory, and doing a very basic tourist tour at Pagani, we were due to leave the Modena/Sant'Agata area, and continue on our road trip. I actually don't remember exactly how this came up, but I happened to speak with an Italian friend from Chicago, Gabe, who happened to be good friends with Horacio Pagani, and who was aghast that we had gone to the factory as mere tourists, and not even met Horacio himself. So he had it arranged that we would go back to Pagani the very next day, so we could get a proper tour, and meet Horacio. We again marveled at the Zondas sitting in the reception. We saw the autoclave that had started the Pagani business as a maker of carbon fiber in the 1990s, after he left Lamborghini because they wouldn't pursue these composite materials that Horacio believed would be the future of the supercar world (and how right he was!). We even got test drives in an orange Zonda F by their fearless test driver, Davide Testi, who thought nothing of drifting the car at full chat about the narrow roads around the factory. And afterwards, by Horacio himself in a silver car. By lunch, it was already the most epic day of a most epic trip, but by dinner, it would have turned into one of the most epic days of my entire life. See, after all the tours, all the sights, all the sounds, we somehow let it be known that it was indeed my all-time car dream to own a Zonda, but that I had heard they were all sold. Which is when Alberto, the soft-spoken sales manager for Pagani, subtly suggested that maybe, just maybe, it would be possible for us to commission our very own custom Zonda. Oh, and in fact, they had a project that had already reached the finished tub state of production, but where the customer had bailed, and perhaps we could take this over, and design our own Zonda? And we could call it The Pagani Zonda HH. !!! Before the day was over, we had signed the paperwork to commission a one million-euro hypercar with Horacio Pagani himself. Oh, and attended a special gala night celebrating a new book about Pagani that had just come out that same day. From a moment that shouldn't even have been, which started out as a mere tourist visit, to an insane purchase of an insane car. The design collaboration continued over the next couple of months. Horacio and his team sent over paint samples, renderings, and after a few back'n'forths, we had our design: Because we had taken over a project that was already well-advanced, the car got completed incredibly quickly. We signed in July, and by November it was time to take delivery. Unfortunately (or fortunately, as it would turn out), the weather had turned in Italy by then, and Pagani suggested we take delivery of the car in Marbella instead. They had a dealership there. So we flew to Spain. And what followed was another string of magical days with Horacio Pagani, Alberto, and the owner of the Spanish Pagani dealership Mario. This was the trip where we fell in love with Marbella, got introduced to the incredible track that is Ascari, and had Horacio himself fill up our car with gas! This is all now over twelve years ago. Not only do we still own the Pagani Zonda HH, but it is still my favorite car of all-time. The grail. The one we'll never sell. The one that fills me with child-like glee and awe whenever we take off the cover, even if it's just to stare at it. And in celebration of impossible dreams that occasionally do come true, I'm getting back on Instagram to share some of those bedroom poster pictures of the Zonda, and other street and race cars I've been so fortunate to own or drive. I quit Instagram (for the second time!) a couple of years ago, and I don't intend to use it like I did then, but also, I've grown tired of how this modern quest to problematize everything seems to expand endlessly. Yes, Instagram can be a pit of death by comparison, but it can also just be an app to look at cool cars. Can we just enjoy some of those second best things in life that the world has to offer? Without being a bore about every which way it's inevitably a symptom of late-stage capitalism or whatever? Be it by ownership or by proxy. Drink it in with moderation, sure, but also get out of that fun-killing daze where participation in every hobby is sucked dry by excessive and sanctimonious self-critique. I've come to consider that even more ostentatious than a bright yellow Lamborghini these days. So thank you, Doug DeMuro, for reminding me what being into cars in public can also be. I salute you with instagram.com/dhhdrives, and pictures of my own all-time dream car. May you see as many joyous miles in your Carrera GT, as I've done in my Pagani Zonda HH! Oh, and like Doug, Jamie and I loved the Zonda so much we even featured it in our wedding. Which was held at Ascari. All because that one epic day went the way it did and not another.", "date": "2023-02-16T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Some two million people gawked at that lovely Catalina Island-facing view that forms the background for work when I'm there. Here's another shot of that same office from the early morning: It really is my dream office. But at the same time, it's also just an office, and the most enjoyable part of that is the creative work that happens on the 27\" glass rectangle. The relationship between the two is epitomized by Coco Chanel's wonderful quote: The best things in life are free. The second best things are very, very expensive. The best thing about work is getting the opportunity to exercise your human capacity for creativity, ingenuity, progress. Having a nice view is one of those \"second best things\", and the gap between the two is existential. I would never contemplate to give up \"the best thing\", a work life filled with engaging, challenging tasks of meaning, for more, or any!, of those \"second best things\", like a nice view. To illustrate, here's another photo of a home office. This was mine from 2004-2005 while working from Copenhagen. This is where Ruby on Rails was created. This is where Basecamp was written. This dim room holds claim to some of the greatest intellectual achievements of my entire career. AND I LOVED IT! Not because of the room – it was just as dim and cluttered as it looked – but because of what happened in that room. Nobody is going to look at that office with envy because its allure is entirely internal. But I look at that office with at least as much fondness as I do the present one in Malibu. And I kinda wish that more people would find as much inspiration from this as they do the other. For one, it's far more achievable, but more importantly, it's the essence of a good work life: A place of calm for interruption-free pursuits of interesting projects. A portal to the state of flow. Again, this isn't a rejection of \"the second best things\". Life is good if you are so #blessed as to enjoy both, but lose sight of the first, or worse yet, trade it in against the second, and you will have squandered Chanel's insight. Your first mission in life ought to be to ensure that all those free, best things are solidly in place before caring to chase the rest of the list. Because if that latter chase doesn't yield the spoils, so what, you'll still be #winning at life from a hand flush with aces.", "date": "2023-02-09T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

And our expectations for software quality are profoundly unrealistic. Thus, lots of people are continuously disappointed — even enraged — by software bugs. They shouldn’t be. The only reliable, widely used way to ensure impeccable software quality is to write less software that does less stuff, and then spend eons honing that tiny lot. Such an approach, however, is very rarely compatible with commercial success or even programmer motivations (despite what many may claim). How do you think the market would receive the iPhone 7, if its headline improvement was cutting 1/3 of the features to shrink the code base so it’d have fewer bugs? Yeah, I thought so. While people may get excited in concept by “stop the train, we need to fix the tracks” directives for software development, it’s not what they would buy. Well, but then there’s the argument: Apple is so rich, can’t they just hire more developers and testers to fix all the bugs? To paraphrase Frederick Brooks: No. Software development doesn’t work like that. Throwing ever bigger teams at problems usually just makes the problems bigger still. Bugs are an inevitable byproduct of writing software. Sure, there are all sorts of techniques and potions that promise to decrease how many of the damn critters run about, but only the comically hyperbole pretends that complete eradication is possible. Once we accept that simple fact that software = bugs, we can progress to understand why fixing them may not even be that important a lot of the time. The absence of bugs is simply one parameter of success in software, but not even close to the most important one (with some exception for life critical systems). Useless software can be entirely bug free, yet remain entirely useless. Useful software can be ridden with bugs, yet remain highly valuable. Or, the value of software depends far more upon the problem it solves than the quality by which it does so. Sometimes the dichotomy isn’t that black and white, of course. You could have two pieces of software that solve the same problem, and it’s reasonable to think that the one with fewer bugs would do better. Though even that simple statement is often laughably disproven by the market. Factors such as existing adoption, integrations, brand, and fun often trump quality as well. Given that there are so many factors more important to the future prospects of a software package and its makers, is it really that surprising not every bug gets “drop everything, we gotta fix this” priority? Of course not. But we, as users who hit a bug, still constantly pretend that it is. It’s really the pinnacle of myopia when we as users demand and demean software makers to fix our pet bug, just because we hit it, and just because it may have caused anything from a slight annoyance to loss of some time. The value of a any given bug can be rated by the number of users affected times the criticality of the issue. Lots of users are losing all their data due to this bug? Okay, then, Very Damn Important! Fix it NOW! Lots of users are a little annoyed or confused by this? Probably should fix it some time soon. A few users have to spend another 30 seconds on a work around? Unlikely to get fixed any time soon! Software organizations that stay in business triage their backlog of bugs like that. They do not drop everything to deal with any damn bug. As the economies of scale kick in, so does the magnitude of consequences from such triaging. Large software packages and organizations will have hundreds if not thousands if not TENS OF THOUSANDS of open bugs of various criticality. THIS IS NORMAL. THIS IS EXPECTED. This is not a call to give up on software quality, quite the contrary. This is a call to remove the highly charged emotional responses of encountering the world as it should be expected to spin. Demeaning developers, questioning their professionalism (whatever that means!), or feigning outrage at that which ails all software makes everyone, including users, worse off. So next time you hit an annoying bug, give it five minutes before you fire off that indignant tweet. Marvel at the miracle it is that anything as complex as a modern piece of software works at all! Consider the billions of instructions our work-horse CPUs have to get just right for you to enjoy the splendors of computing. Have some sympathy for man and machine. I originally wrote this in 2016. Seven years later, it's just as true. HEY has bugs. Basecamp has bugs. Hopefully fewer than the competition, hopefully none of them critical.", "date": "2023-02-07T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

I looked at four factors: 1) the likely judicial defeat of affirmative action in universities, 2) the disintegration and scandalization of BLM, 3) the loss of Twitter as an effective woke policing mechanism, and 4) finally the coming mass layoffs in tech. Now comes the proof that we've indeed seen the corporate peak. Companies that were once very vocal on human rights and societal issues have held statements close to the vest or stayed completely silent following the recent streak of tragedies in America. This is a major shift in the way leaders communicate during heightened moments of tragedy and crisis. Most have now opted for internal correspondence in place of public pledges — and some are saying nothing at all. The writer is clearly rendering this reality through a lens of lamentation, but still has to accept similar points of analysis as to why this is happening, like 'economic uncertainty': The tech industry — which was previously out front on many of these issues — is now going through massive cuts and is focused on staying afloat, not wading in. Plus, many tech companies have gutted their DEI departments in response to economic strains. Another point mentioned is simply 'fatigue', which again is spot on, but also not something to decry. There's a very distinct limit on how often most folks want to hear from the maker of the candy bar, the producer of their soap, or the purveyor of their software on societal and political topics. And we've clearly reached that limit! Good! The Axios article ends with this bizarre postulate: 'Corporate silence could crater civil discourse'. What? Unless mega corporations weigh in on our politics, it'll crater civil discourse? Haven't progressives in particular just spent the last half century at least hemming and hawing over the influence of big corporations on public discourse and politics?! The problem with the lack of corporate involvement, just like the lack of Twitter's overt censorship regime, is obviously primarily that it marks an absence of support from a very particular narrative and political orientation. I'm certain this same writer would be quick to call for corporations to shut up, if they replaced the 'corporate silence' with support for a counterposition. THIS IS WHY WE SHOULDN'T WANT CORPORATIONS WEIGHING IN ON SOCIAL AND POLITICAL QUESTIONS OUTSIDE THEIR DIRECT SPHERE OF OPERATIONS. Let individual members of said corporations engage in politics to their hearts content as sovereign citizens in a democracy. But spare us the sanctimonious press releases, with their carefully rehearsed thoughts & prayers, on company letterhead, from the outfits that stock our commodities.", "date": "2023-02-03T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Granted, that doesn't mean it's actually small, just smaller. It's almost as big as a regular iPhone 14. Much bigger than the iPhone 13 mini that's otherwise been in my pocket for the last year and a half. But at 169 grams, it feels way nicer in the hand than the iPhone 14 Pro does at 203.

That's a basic truism of just about any field, and programming is no different. But competence isn't the only input to pace. Risk tolerance is just as important, if not more so. You can't go quickly if you treat every problem with the diligence required for rocket surgery. If your work can directly kill people, think guided missiles or pacemakers, you damn well better put all your emphasis on safety. Speed of execution is a distance priority at this ultimate level of criticality. If your work can result directly in the loss of millions or billions of dollars, you also better approach it with an unusually high level of care. And yet, it's clearly still nowhere near as bad as dealing with the direct loss of human life, if you get it wrong. The criticality ladder keeps going down from there. Loss of important data. Loss of critical access to data. Loss of replicated data. Imposed inconvenience. And that's when it starts getting interesting. Once you're far enough down the ladder that it isn't obvious which step you're on, and how much care is appropriate. I'm no fan of Zuckerberg in general, but I think he got it right by making \"move fast and break things\" the development slogan in the early days of Facebook. A nascent social network is exactly where understanding what's critical (very few things) and what's not (most things) is crucial. A startup struggling to find market fit in that domain should indeed favor pace over prudence. You can argue at what point that slogan should have been retired, once Facebook was no longer a startup. But that's separate from the fact that this is fundamentally a good posture of almost any early startup – when the key criticality to worry about is going out of business. At more mundane levels of importance, we deal with this question at our company every day. We're constantly, implicitly or explicitly, deciding how much care to take when engaging with the issues. Not in the sense that we can get away with doing a shoddy job, because that rarely if ever works. The price you pay for making a mess is an instant surcharge on both quality and productivity. But in the sense that there's a wide spectrum from mess to good enough to worthy of running a human heart. And this is where organizational expectations come in. Zuckerberg set those clearly: It's OK if some things break, as long as we're moving forward, we can fix them. I have a lot of sympathy for that approach, especially in the beginning. In the early days of Basecamp, we explicitly chose to involve our initial customers as part of the Q&A process. We'd put out something pretty good, but then let our customers tell us where the edge cases were, because there weren't that many customers, and the edge cases usually weren't of that high criticality. These days we have a lot more rigor in the process, including actual Q&A personnel reviewing most new features and major fixes before they ship. Simply because shipping something obviously broken, and then hearing from 1,000 people in five minutes, who all need a human reply, would be a bad deal at our current scale. And yet still we have to make the determination: Is this worthy of the bigger process? Our could we just ship it, and see what happens? Knowing when to accept the risk of the latter is part of how you prevent getting bogged down in process for things that just don't merit it. And sometimes you'll get that wrong! Something that looked innocuous will be consequential, and you have to clean it up. That's the nature of the criticality bet. You need to have the stomach to keep playing, even if you occasionally lose a hand. You're playing anyway unless you're doing the crazy multiple-teams-doing-adversarial-solutions stuff that I've heard of in pacemaker development. So don't sweat it, calibrate it! That calibration comes best from the top, though. If executive wrath bears down upon you after any little mistake, you'll naturally just stop taking the appropriate risk, lest you tempt a small chance of getting chewed out. Organizations that work like this in the face of criticality that does not warrant it become lethargic. It's perhaps somewhat ironic that Zuckerberg should be the poster for an appropriate level of criticality setting from the early days of Facebook, because by the testimony of John Carmack, it sounds like they've since totally Maybe that's why there's a specific charm about young entrepreneurs. Free of scars from past losses, they can push in a way that grizzled veterans might not. This often gets turned into a caricature for derision, like Tech Bros. But the world needs a mix. We need youngsters blessed with the bliss of ignorance to push the envelope where the stakes are lower. And then some old-timers weathered by wisdom to pull the envelope when the stakes tip large. Regardless of what the mix looks like at your company, you ought to think about what is actually critical, and where you can get away with running with scissors. Speed of execution is one of the most important organizational features in most areas of competition. Something that's doable in in a week might be a great investment, but if you spend six doing the same thing, with excess care, you're wasting your time. The natural tendency is to start slowing down, too.

This was late 90s/early 00s, and there was a rich ecosystem of enterprise vendors hawking application servers, monitoring tools, and boxes upon boxes of other fancy solutions. These tools were difficult to learn, expensive to license, and required an army of contractors, consultants, and sales people to purchase, configure, and run. All to do essentially what a Perl CGI script or PHP page could also do: Pull data from a database, and render it as HTML to a browser! It's not that there weren't good ideas hiding underneath the cruft of complexity required to vendorize these solutions. But that the ratio between Good Idea and Bullshit was completely out of whack. That out-of-balance ratio seeded the original mission for Rails: To liberate the good ideas from the bullshit. To flush out all the nonsense, and to compress the remaining intrinsic complexity, so mere mortals without an advanced degree in enterprisey gibberish could employ the hidden gems of ingenuity that really were present. It worked! Rails introduced a deep catalogue of solid patterns from J2EE and elsewhere to a group of programmers that never would have had the patience to use them in their original wrapping. And it gave those already versed in the patterns a simpler environment to exploit them. It also drained away much of the enterprisey swamp in the process. There just wasn't room for the same breadth and depth of commercial vendors selling their convoluted wares to an ecosystem of companies and developers running commodity hardware with commodity databases, web servers, and simple open-source programming frameworks. But the merchants of complexity don't close up shop just because a single market dries up. They migrate to the next. And shortly after Rails came to the scene, the next big complexity gold rush was to be Web Services, also known as WS-* (or, as I referred to it back in the day, WS-DeathStar). Like with the original J2EE spec, which sought to complicate the basic mechanics of connecting databases via HTML to the internet, this new avalanche of specifications under the WS-* umbrella sought to complicate the basic mechanics of making applications talk to each other over the internet. With such riveting names as WS-SecurityPolicy, WS-Trust, WS-Federation, WS-SecureConversation, and on and on ad nauseam, this monstrosity of complexity mushroomed into a cloud of impenetrable specifications in no time. All seemingly written by and for the same holders of those advanced degrees in enterprisey gibberish. Thankfully, just like J2EE itself, this XML-infested mess quickly imploded under the pressure of the plain alternative: Just sending JSON over standard HTTPS to servers running whatever on the backend. While practitioners argued for years about what level of purity was required to really be called RESTful, it didn't really matter. The internet voted with its web requests, and simple JSON over HTTPS once again beat back the merchants of complexity to save the human race of programmers from a regrouping empire. Today you'll still find fragments of the old world around the internet. A reference to SOAP here, some bank still running an original J2EE stack there. But the wide world of the internet belongs to much simpler tooling and ideas in forms such as Rails, JSON, REST, and commodity databases and web servers. (JavaScript is an interesting hybrid case that needs its own exploration, but I'll align it more with the rebels than the empire for the purposes of this discussion). But as with WS-* rising from the same incentives that drove J2EE, you should always expect the merchants of complexity to start rebuilding their Death Star in another unsuspecting galaxy, once one is destroyed in your own. The struggle between profitless simplicity and profitable complexity is eternal in the world of software. When things become too easy, too approachable, there just isn't room for all the enterprisey services, sales, and solutions to prosper. That finally brings us to the latest frontier: Containerized running of software in the cloud! The initial advancement and popularization of containers rank as one of my favorite milestones of progress in our industry. But damn if the merchants of complexity didn't see such simplicity as a bug to quickly correct, and use their impressive tractor beam of bullshit to pull us back towards the ever-reconstructing Death Star once more. Again, I'm certain that there are good ideas hidden inside the advancement of Kubernetes, and the mushrooming of tools, services, and standards that are following in its wake, but the ratio of bullshit is also already completely out of whack. What are we trying to do here? We're trying to run an application on some hardware in a reasonably efficient manner, where we can easily redeploy it when it changes. Yeah, sure, fair. But try contrasting what's required to get going with Kubernetes, both within your application, and to operate control planes and what not, with the breakthrough simplicity of the original Docker advancement, and it's damn depressing. But also predictable. The complexity that's been conjured up is immensely profitable. The renewed demand for advanced degrees in enterprisey gibberish is propelling the same expansion of jargon, specifications, and techniques as we saw with J2EE and WS-DeathStar. This is what this industry does! In hindsight, it usually always looks silly. Try reading some of those early 2000s manuals for WebSphere or whatever and you'll marvel at the incantations that were used to be required to simply get to Hello World. Or I dare you to digest some of those WS-* specifications, and try to make sense of it all. It's technical masochism. But when you're in the thick of it, it usually all seems far more, if not reasonable, then at least excusable. Yes, this is all horrendously complicated, but look at what we can do! And really, here are 17 reasons for why the simple approach is just naive or unsophisticated. If you can't see the splendor of the king's fine threads, surely it is you, little boy, who is mistaken.

Now at first, we actually thought this wasn't going to be an issue. Enterprise sales is notorious for stratospheric list prices that are then discounted back to earth to actually close a deal. When we buy our beloved Dell servers, we often end up with discounts of 80%! So spec'ing out a $10,000 server doesn't feel like such a splurge, if the real price is actually just $2,000. If that had been a similar story here, this two-million dollar contract would have been $400,000/year. Still way too much, but we could have scaled back a bit here and there, and perhaps ended up at something we could live with. But when we pressed them on the belly for the discount, the answer was 3. Three percent. Yeah, okay, but no. Now who am I tell tell someone what the market will bear. I hear that SUSE is doing well selling these packages to the military and insurance companies.

In all the US state actions, for example, it seemed the basic political corruption available to any trillion-dollar company willing to buy all the lobbyists in the land, connecting that to campaign contributions, and propping up puppet industry groups was an effective strategy. Same too with individual countries, like South Korea and The Netherlands, who let their enforcement flounder on otherwise promising judgements. The result was little relief for the millions of developers being shaken down for billions of dollars by Apple and Google for passage to users' phones. But now it appears as if Apple and Google has finally met a leviathan they cannot buy, cajole, or threaten: The EU. At first, I was skeptical that the Digital Markets Act, which passed earlier this year but doesn't come into full effect until 2024, would actually deliver. Bitten by disappointment a few too many times before, I thought, Apple and Google would probably just find a way to defy the law, delay the law, or simply ignore the law, and again, app developers would be left with no relief. I clearly shouldn't have been so dour about the prospects, though, because here comes the reports that Apple are preparing to comply. With alternative app stores, with side loading, with letting app developers use their own payment processing (without the ludicrous penalty rates!), with opening up the NFC chip to competitors, with alternate browser engines. It's basically the most ambitious wishlist everyone could present to Santa Antitrust, and Apple is reportedly working – however begrudgingly – to comply with it all! As Mark Gurman reports for Bloomberg, the reality of why is sheer market power. Europe accounts for $95 billion in sales for Apple. It's the second biggest market after the Americas. Bigger than China. Too big for Apple to lose. And the EU has put their full weight behind getting compliance with the DMA. Repeat offenders are liable for up to 20% of global revenues. It simply isn't viable for Apple (or Google) to refuse to comply now that it really does appear that the EU is serious about tackling these mobile monopolists. Hallelujah! This is frankly the most exciting development in the tech world since I don't know when. As dazzled as I am by ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, I'm even more excited about the notion of setting the phones free. Free for all the business models that couldn't work with a 30% haircut, free from the gatekeeper nonsense keeping developers from releasing software, and freedom for users to install the apps they damn well please. Just like they've done for decades on their computers! I also think, ironically, that this is good for Apple. Their monopolistic bullying, their shakedown tactics, and their sense of entitlement to a cut of all the economic activity happening on their computers has done more to damage the relationship with developers than even that ghastly five year nightmare of the butterfly keyboards! Apple used to be an aspirational company for most developers, but then it turned out to just as bad of a boss as the last big boss (Microsoft), although somehow worse. The DMA holds the promise to return Apple to an earlier age without these gluttonous service and tax aspirations driving seemingly every major decision at the company. The EU just might make Apple lovable again by outlawing their monopolistic excesses. What a twist. Yes, that'll cost them billions in missed toll fees in the short run, but ultimately offer a path to better long-term stability.

The drama that decision created was immense, and all-consuming for a few weeks. We trended on Twitter for a while, there were countless, breathless articles covering the move, and ultimately, we said farewell to twenty-some employees as a result. We weren't the first to do this, just early, and being early can be costly. But the results, despite the (very) difficult transition, have ultimately been worth it.This is what I wrote about our decision at the time: By trying to have the debates around such incredibly sensitive societal politics inside the company, we're setting ourselves up for strife, with little chance of actually changing anyone's mind. These types of discussions are so difficult that even if we were having them at the best of times, together in person, with trust batteries fully charged, we'd struggle. And we have none of those advantages right now, so it's not a surprise the results have been poor. We also like to tell ourselves that having these discussions with the whole company is \"healthy\". I used to think that too, but I no longer do. I think it's become ever more stressful, unnerving, and counterproductive. No comment thread on Basecamp is going to close the gap on fundamental philosophical and political differences. And we're left worse for wear when we try. I stand by that analysis. I also stand by our conclusion: Therefore, we’re asking everyone, including Jason and me, to refrain from using our company Basecamp or HEY to discuss societal politics at work effective immediately. Next, Basecamp, as a company, is no longer going to weigh-in publicly on societal political affairs, outside those that directly connect to the business. Again, everyone can individually weigh-in as much or as little as they want, but we're done with posts that present a Basecamp stance on such issues. The long-term benefits of that new etiquette are clear now that we've had to live with the results for a while. It's been a night'n'day improvement inside the company compared to the few years that proceeded it. Again, the most difficult transition we've ever done, but probably also one of the most valuable for the long-term health of our company culture. It seems like Brian Armstrong from Coinbase has arrived at the same assessment on [their even-earlier move to skip societal politics at work](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company). From [an interview with Ben Thompson of Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-coinbase-founder-and-ceo-brian-armstrong-about-ftx-and-crypto-realities/)a few days ago: I would do it over again... I think that’s a much better way to run a company, and many companies have followed suit and emulated it since then. You want to have an environment where everybody’s respected, treated fairly, you can learn from your colleagues, do great work, but it’s focused on the mission. And people aren’t just fighting with each other all day or getting distracted by unnecessary things. Or you don’t have, in the worst case, activists actually hijacking the company for their own purposes, and that’s kind of even worse. So I feel good about that decision. I think it’s proven to be the right call. And actually even the companies that were the most against it, some of them have reached out and said, “Oh my God, we’re having this problem, how did you guys handle it?” Behind the scenes. So that’s been validating. Now comes more validation, as Meta just announced internally that they're following the path taken by Coinbase and 37signals. Fortune [reported a few days ago](https://fortune.com/2022/12/06/meta-facebook-bans-internal-discussion-abortion-gun-rights-vaccines-roe-v-wade/)that Lori Goler, the head of people at Meta, made the following announcement: As Mark mentioned recently, we need to make a number of cultural shifts to help us deliver against our priorities. We’re doing this to ensure that internal discussions remain respectful, productive, and allow us to focus. This comes with the trade-off that we’ll no longer allow for every type of expression at work, but we think this is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our internal community. We’re increasing the number of topics that can no longer be discussed at work based on what we’ve seen to be very disruptive in the past. The issues that can no longer be discussed include health matters such as vaccine efficacy and abortion, legal matters such as pending legislation, political matters such as elections or political movements, and weapon ownership and rights. We’ve updated our employee expectations to provide direction around what is appropriate for our people in the workplace, so that we can reduce distractions while maintaining an environment that is respectful and inclusive and where people can do their best work. We are often asked to sign on to advocacy letters on topics that are important, but not directly connected to our work. This can distract us from focusing on issues that are not central to our mission. So going forward, as a company we will only make public statements on issues that are core to our business, meaning they are required in order to provide our service. So virtually the same etiquette pivot around societal politics at work, and the same declaration that Meta won't be making political statements unrelated to its business going forward as well. You'd think that such an important shift for a company that still has more than 70,000 employees would be A Very Big Deal to all the journalists, activists, and internet commentators who lost their shit when Coinbase and 37signals first took that position. Especially since Meta isn't even offering employees who might disagree with the new policy the generous buy-out offers that Coinbase and we did. But you'd be wrong. It's been crickets. In fact, I didn't even notice the original report from Fortune until [Business Insider picked it up](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-reportedly-bans-staff-from-discussing-abortion-guns-vaccines-2022-12)in very muted tones a few days later. A [Twitter thread covering the change](https://twitter.com/rmac18/status/1600617942105800705)from a New York Times reporter similarly got zero traction. But that's what real progress looks like. That we in less than two years can go from no-politics etiquettes being major industry news, when a company of sixty people does it, to being a complete nothingburger, when a company of 70,000+ does it. It also connects directly to my prediction from a couple of weeks ago that we're in [the waning days of DEI's dominance](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-waning-days-of-dei-s-dominance-9a5b656c). Most people are simply ready to move on from this nonsense. They don't actually want to discuss abortion, gun rights, vaccine efficacy, or elections with their coworkers during work hours in work forums. And they shouldn't have to. So let's hope the fact that Meta's new no-politics etiquette dropped with zero waves will convince other companies that it's safe for them to do the same. After living with this type of etiquette for some time now, I would not want to go back.", "date": "2022-12-09T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

For the power and dignity of self-determination, according to the norms and laws of their culture. Independently of staying in the good grace of foreign powers. Without digital sovereignty, we cannot claim to be free in the 21st century. I stake the claim that we in the Nordics, as well as we in the rest of Europe, are indeed not free under this definition of digital sovereignty. Neither in a broad human sense nor in a narrow commercial sense. We are hopelessly dependent on the good grace of foreign powers and corporations to operate the digital realm of our societies and our companies, and we've let our norms, laws, and ability to compete be overturned as a result. This wasn't always the case. When I started working with the internet in the early 90s, it really did seem like we were going to have a worldwide web that was as diverse as it was distributed. Hell, when I was working in Denmark during the dot-com days, we even had our own search engine with Jubii.dk! Back then, most companies even operated their own email infrastructure (even if it might have run Microsoft Exchange). And their websites were usually hosted on their own company servers too. At the dawn of the new millennium, the worldwide web was full of worldwide autonomy and independence. But out of the rubble of the dot-com bust rose the centralization of all essential services. And from that, our present gilded age for digital monopolies. During that period, we slowly ceded our European digital sovereignty in return for American tech convenience and competence. So what started out as a worldwide web of collaboration became a web of entanglement. We Europeans went from being part of producing the silk to ending up as prey in the net. Or allow me another imperfect analogy: Europe became a digital colony. A region of 750 million people with few to no major, native tech services. Reduced to a vast pool of data, a captive collection of eyeballs, and potential in-app payment taxes for the great powers of the internet to contest. This digital colony of Europe has been essential to building some of the most valuable, powerful, and entrenched conglomerates the world has ever seen. Trillion-dollar tech companies that today touch, if not control, all facets of modern life and commerce in our digital age. What have we gotten in return? If I was glib, I'd say But we should change our tactics, if we keep getting pummeled on home court. And that's exactly what's happening in Europe in its current sorry state as a digital colony. What we're giving up by ceding all this control to American tech monopolies and conglomerates is not only a huge portion of our economy, which is getting funneled out of our region through These transactions aren't just being settled in money but attention and data too. Extracted with the care of a Colorado shale driller. Leaving behind a wake of toxic public conversations, surveillance capitalism, and rapidly declining mental health amongst teenagers in particular. It's a terrible deal on all possible parameters, and we've barely even begun to realize how badly we've been ripped off. So what's a concerned Nordic supposed to do? And a broader Europe after that? Let me propose three radical ideas. #1: Embrace Protectionism Free trade is a fantasy. Some times it's a useful fantasy, but often it's also just a convenient cover for opening new markets in sectors where your region is strong, and closing them off where it is weak or needs nurture. Nobody has shown this to better effect than the Chinese when it comes to digital services. China is the only great power with real independence in the digital realm, and they acquired that independence by shamelessly embracing tech protectionism. Europeans might look at the outcome of that embrace with horror, and rightly so. China has used its digital sovereignty to institute an authoritarian surveillance and censorship state that no freedom-loving person could ever cheer for. But there's no denying its unique effectiveness in establishing an internal order built on Chinese norms and laws, however flawed to our eyes (and objective notions of freedom). Europe should learn from this. Like we'd learn from any foreign power in a power struggle when trying to decide how to come out ahead in the next round. The Americans also seem to have few qualms about this. There's an ongoing debate as to whether TikTok should be forced to sell its US operations to a US company or even banned in the country outright. The tariff regime that was introduced under Trump has largely continued under Biden as well. This is not a country that's shy about using its market power to open or close sectors as it sees fit. And in so many other domains outside of tech, Europe isn't exactly a novice in protectionism either. The European Union revolves much of its activity around agricultural market protectionism. We seem keenly aware that ensuring European food production is strong enough to keep us self-sufficiently fed is a wise policy goal. But when it comes to the digital domain, we often act as blue-eyed idealists about the myth of totally free markets. This is unwise. It's also an illustration of willful ignorance. Just like our dangerous dependency on foreign energy. The fact that Europe allowed itself to face emergency energy rationing this winter is just the latest case in point. That fact is this: Globalism is dead. If you didn't get the message from Wuhan, you hopefully got it from Moscow. Yes, accepting the end of paradigm is hard, but denying it will be harder still. Europe needs to resettle its digital house on a foundation that won't crack the second trouble with China or Russia or even America emerges, as it inevitably will. This might all sound like big geopolitical questions that small nations like Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland are ill-positioned to engage with unilaterally. Let alone individual companies within these countries. And while that's true to some extent, we are also uniquely well-positioned to embrace protectionism on account of our small size, and agile political processes. Take the case of Uber in Denmark. This is one of many examples where a large American tech-powered giant showed up to upend an industry, in this case taxis. The plan initially appeared to work, and Uber brought in gig-economy ethics to a labor market almost entirely unfamiliar with such a concept. This assault caused immense tension: What do we do now? The answer: Protectionism! By using the Danish rules about seat sensors and taximeters, we were able to successfully eject Uber from the market. I'd argue we're much better off for it (although the brief scare surely did help motivate our native taxi industry to improve, so at least there's that!). This was a good outcome anchored in a realist's understanding of markets and free trade. But we need to think much bigger if we want to make headway against the bigger, more menacing tech monopolies who are extracting data, attention, and wealth from our region. Protectionism is the framework for our digital sovereignty. So where do we start? #2: Outlaw the business model The single most effective way we could use the principle of protectionism is by outlawing the business model of surveillance capitalism. Thus resetting the competitive landscape for everything from search engines to social networks, and thereby allowing native Nordic and European alternatives to be cultivated. From Google to Facebook to Twitter, much of the American tech industry is built upon the violation of our European principles of privacy. Services that have achieved the holy grail of alchemy: Turning the worst, most divisive, most enraging content on the internet into gold. All by tracking every aspect of the eyeballs that view it, and selling that invasion of privacy to advertisers. It doesn't matter what kind of content sludge you serve, if you're able to monetize the eyeballs looking at it. This business model is what makes these services so valuable, so viral, and so hard to unseat by European upstarts built on different ethics. But allowing ads in Europe to be targeted on the basis of your personal data is a choice. And Europe could make a different one. We don't let alcohol and tobacco companies advertise in many venues and ways in much of Europe. There are rules around how you can advertise to kids. There are rules about what you're allowed to say in your advertisements almost everywhere. It's not like we have some ideological commitment to letting all advertisement in operate in all ways. If we cut off the American tech companies from relying on a targeted-ads approach in Europe, we'd instantly level the playing field for European competitors, who'd find other ways to monetize their services. It's the kind of disruption that opens new possibilities for competition by unseating the advantage held by the incumbents. Europe has already taken several swings at this privacy issue too. From the GDPR to the cookie disclosures to Max Schrems' legal victories in the European Court of Justice. These all revolve around the same European repulsion to having our private information used against us in the realm of commerce or in data dragnets, like those operates by American intelligence services. The sad conclusion, though, is that despite all these movements, Europe still wavers on what it really wants. The cookie disclosure banners might have had good intention behind them, but they've ultimately been tuned out by consumers, and thus ended up ineffective at providing any real protection. Not the least because companies will find a million ways to extract some fig-leaf version of consent, if we let them. The GDPR is perhaps the single piece of European legislation that has had some real effect. It's based on some solid European principles of privacy. It's codified a whole language that we can use to talk about processors, sub-processors, legitimate consent, and more. But enforcement is also almost entirely absent, in part because the whole regime is such a sprawling mess. The same is true of the recently defeated Privacy Shield. Yes, great that the European Court of Justice has struck down this blatant subversion of our privacy ideals, but so far it's mostly just left a vacuum for companies unsure of what to do next. Are standard contractural clauses the answer? Or should we wait for Privacy Shield 2.0 with some platitudes from the Americans? As long as Europe doesn't know what it wants, it obviously can't get it. So taking real, concrete, and big steps, like banning the business model of surveillance capitalism is were we must go, if we are going to make progress. Otherwise it all just becomes kabuki theater that serves nobody but the lawyers and bureaucrats who pretend pushing out minor revisions to privacy policies or collecting enough meaningless checkboxes on their website actually matters. It doesn't. Europe should put up or shut up about privacy. #3: Become independent But if we've relearned one thing over the past decade, it's that predicting grand political solutions can be a tricky business. Sometimes it seems like nothing is ever going to get done, and then suddenly it all happens at once. Europeans have slaughtered more holy cows on, say, energy policy this year than perhaps ever before. Who had the sentiment on nuclear power turning 180 degrees in the year 2022 on their bingo card? Not many. So the best business can do is prepare for the general, tectonic trends, rather than try to time the earthquake itself. To me, it seems that the obvious consequence of globalism dying that we need to prepare for a far more independent Europe. A more self-sufficient one. Let's not be like the companies deepening their ties in Russia after 2014. Or those continuing to invest in new production facilities in China after Covid. It's basic risk management to anticipate that the world is heading towards a set of major regions drifting apart. So if you're still setting up your marketing infrastructure using Google Analytics, it's probably time to reconsider. If you're excited about moving all your digital infrastructure onto clouds from Amazon, Google, or Microsoft, I think you should double check the long-term weather forecast. The further away you place your operations, be they in computing or manufacturing, the harder it's going to be to protect them when the long-haul lights of the world flickers. Ultimately, the energy crisis from Russia's war on Ukraine, and the supply chain crisis from China's endless lockdowns over Covid, are wakeup calls for all other forms of commercial dependencies. If you think this is only about energy or only about physical supply chains, you're missing the bigger warning, and you'll be caught by surprise when the next quake hits. The only way to get ready for the unexpected is to become self-sufficient. Europe as a region is more than large enough that it ought to not only pursue its own digital sovereignty, and big enough that it's embarrassing we haven't secured it yet. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today. Let's plant the political and commercial seeds we need to ensure Europe's digital destiny leads us to sovereignty now.

Why bother with these hassles and limitations, if a subscription to a managed cloud service could solve it all? Why indeed, said millions of businesses, and signed up for But the pendulum has been swinging between the client and the server for a long time in computing, and I think we might be at the cusp of another iteration back to where we were. The hassles of dealing with software products from the early 2000s have been understood, and at the same time, the limitations of software services in the 2020s loom much larger. Let's look at some of the compelling reasons for why we might get a resurgence in software products at the expense of services. First from the perspective of the customer: Leaving your data in possession of others also means they can both pass it on in response to legal requests, marketing opportunities, or worse. Let alone the trouble you might face, if you displease the custodian who, in their complete sovereignty, always hold the power to have you banished. Refusing service on individual moral, political, or other grounds is something people can do when they're offering a service, not after they've sold you a product. A lesser version of this happens when the service you're relying on decides to launch a mandatory makeover. Ta-dahhhh! The service you were perfectly happy with five minutes ago is now totally alien to you, all the functions have been moved around (and probably hidden in a burger menu), and we hope you'll love it as much as the designers who arrived here yesterday!! Isn't progress fun?! Most business software is bought because it serves a purpose. It's a tool, not entertainment. Novelty ought not be a top priority. It shouldn't need to constantly absorb continued effort for years after it's created. That's not to say that there aren't benefits to new versions, new features, and bug fixes. Of course there are. But these benefits do not have to face the challenge of the market, having to justify another sale. They're simply accepted as defacto blessings in all circumstances, even though they're obviously not. I, for one, would be very happy never to upgrade the firmware of my printer, I don't need any additional features for iA Writer, and I'm still pissed that I can't purchase Adobe Lightroom rather than pay a monthly subscription for it. I wish there was a broad category of software that was offered in its final form. So those are some of the reasons why customers might come to realize that the switch from software products to software services wasn't without serious trade-offs. And they may begin to contemplate whether they wouldn't actually prefer to start buying the former again, if anyone would offer them. But software services also incur serious trade-offs for software makers. Gone seem the days where you could just be a pure business product company, full of folks dedicated to the task of creating software, rather than operators needed to service one master installation 24/7. So let's examine a few of the reasons why some software makers might also want to return to the days of the software product rather than continue to run a service: To mitigate this risk, most large software service vendors have enormous operations teams. People on-call with the obligation to wake up in the middle of the night if something is wrong with the service. And it's even worse for smaller operators. In the early days of Basecamp, I had to travel everywhere with my laptop, and I spent more than a few vacations outside of the hote trying to diagnose and resolve a production problem. Which means invariably tinkering with, changing, and enhancing that same one thing forever. Since part of the service obligation is that customers continue to be \"delighted\" with changes that they get for \"free\" as part of their subscription. The software just keeps getting better (or not)! But there's a reason many software makers pine for the rare opportunity to work on greenfield projects. That lush open space to start fresh with your best ideas, unencumbered by old promises and old decisions, is invigorating. Yes, there are lessons in legacy, but probably more in new attempts. When I read tales of what the early video games industry was like, I certainly get some pangs of envy. Imagine getting to work on something entirely novel every 18-24 months, with a small team entirely focused on a single creative endeavor. (In other regards, like the endless death marches that historically has entailed with game development, I perhaps wouldn't be such a big fan, but hey, trade-offs!) Point being that in the video game industry, there historically was a focus on separating out the creative process from the supporting one, and placing it in separate organizations. You had the creative studios optimizing for what they do best, and then you had the publishers optimizing for supporting and bringing that to market. A separation of concerns that I think had a lot of wisdom to it, even if it's actually also become a lot rarer with modern video game development. For all of these reasons above, alongside the dramatic ease that technical breakthroughs like Docker has made to ease the distribution of business software, I think, or at least hope, that we'll see a resurgence on the product focus in the 2020s and beyond. I dream of being able to both buy and sell finished business software products.", "date": "2022-12-05T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

So it's our nature to imagine – or dread! – where the next dot will land, and what perhaps the not-so-distant future will hold for humanity. But remember: Nobody Knows Anything! That doesn't mean it can't be fun to speculate, though. I think that's why ChatGPT is capturing so much imagination right now. Because the canvas for painting possible futures is incredibly wide right now. Things that seemed far-fetched in 2021 suddenly appear soon-to-be plausible as we close out 2022. Mix in a few other data points, like San Francisco authorizing lethal law enforcement robots, Boston Dynamics' ever-more impressive humanoid robots, Elon's neuralink, consumer AR around the corner, and it's like we have all the ingredients for a Paul Verhoeven movie set in 2025. The line between the absurd and the plausible is blending fast. On the specific consequences, Paul Graham posited the thought that if AI commoditizes mediocre writing, then the very best of human creativity will become even more valuable. Like handmade items standing out in contrast to the mass-produced after the advent of the Industrial Revolution. I like this observation, but even more if we flip the champion of the creativity contest. Because why would we assume that AI won't actually be more creative than mere humans? AI chess and go competitors are in part so superior now because they're capable of wild leaps of ingenuity that stump human players. Moves that would never have been considered by a mere human because of their out-of-norm 'thinking'. In this domain, it's the humans executing mechanical moves based on memorized patterns, the computers making novel inferences. Why shouldn't the same be true of AI generated novels, plays, or movies? What realm of creative production does not benefit from the out-of-the-norm inferences that computers have already proven they can make within the bounds of chess and go to great effect? Is what we call human creativity all that different from a large language model anyway? A distillation of observations, inputs, mimetic tendencies, and a wetware random generator? It's incredibly exciting that we just might soon find out. And the revelation will go straight to the heart of the ageless discussion of what it means to be human. What is consciousness. What is creativity. To even be able to imagine a horizon where these questions are answered, not just within our life time, but within the next decade? Amazing moment to be alive. As much as I like the collective enthusiasm and optimism, though, that this new dot on the AI curve is injecting into the public debate, I think it's worth remembering a few historical parallels. In the late 50s, the foremost thinkers in computer science thought we were just a few years away from general AI. In the 90s, it seemed like the virtual reality revolution was going to happen any minute. And in the mid 2010s, there was a brief euphoria amongst car manufacturers that fleets of robot taxis were imminently going to take over the industry. None of these things happened then or have happened yet. Why? BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING. It's so hard for humans to predict the next epoch. So perhaps that's the next natural step for ChatGPT and its future AI brethren: Tell me, oh great AI oracle, what happens next?", "date": "2022-12-05T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

It's been a profoundly humbling phase of human history for both the experts that predict for a living and the masses trying to sort out who's right. The best approximate conclusion I've been able to draw is this: Nobody Knows Anything. That's of course not literally true. There are specific people who know specific things about specific topics.

The ones with the great recent track record often regress to the mean, and picking the upcoming stars is like a lottery.

I've accepted the fact that the best approximation of the truth usually emerges from the cauldron of opposing elements. Picking a permanent side in some grand ideological struggle – with its prepackaged set of principles and values, enemies and heroes – might bring psychological comfort in the short term, but it'll erode the capacity for intellectual honesty in the long term. The second thing I've done is to try harder to give everything five minutes. What were the motives driving the perpetrator of this specific tragedy? Give it five minutes. What will come of the world if the advances in AI continue current leaps? Give it five minutes (or five years!). Accepting that Nobody Knows Anything does not render all truth relative.

It doesn't seem like this new scientific-sounding buzzword is doing much to arrest the continuing decline in effectiveness of these cancelation tactics, though. Perhaps because American society at large seems to be getting tired of the extremists. Whether they be election deniers or woke scolds.

It's been like this since the advent of capitalism. But few industries have indulged in the excesses of The Good Times to the degree of tech in the past decade. Fueled by investors gorging on loss-making moonshots to fight zero or negative interest rates. Now these investors are seeing their bets burn up 70-80-90% of recent-high valuations as they come crashing back to earth. But while the business cycle has many ill effects, it also has redeeming qualities. It clears the brush of dead wood and puts zombie companies out of their misery. If, and only if, it's allowed to do its job. The trouble is when we go too long without a modest burn. The chaparral accumulates, the risks grow larger, so when it finally rips, the consequences turn catastrophic. That just might be where we are right now. It's been a very long time since the tech industry has had to face the full brunt of a business cycle turning south. Even The Great Financial Crisis, as tough as it was, didn't match the dot-com bust for most tech companies. It's impossible to predict how far this financial fire that's just started will spread, but it's prudent to be prepared for a big one. And that'll be a key differentiator between those who get through the next 12-18-24 months with a few scratches and those who'll loose their heads. The preparation for either outcome is being put in now, and that's when the return on those bad habits come to play.

Suddenly those hundreds of millions of dollars you've raised and burned will be judged as a capital vice. Suddenly the party is over. But out of decadence rises redemption: [flappy and fragile tech companies](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-bubble-has-popped-for-unprofitable-software-companies-2a0a5f57). Fed with excessive capital as early startups, stuffed with absurd rounds of funding as wobbling scale-ups, and finally lobbed onto exuberant public investors at grotesque multiples. Many of these companies have never known real distress, and are thus unfit for the coming financial environment, let alone ready to fight for survival.Because if your company comes of age in the easy times of infinite investments, it's hard not to develop bad habits. From marketing campaigns only measured in top-line lift to hiring drives that overstaff as a point of pride. The [resource curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse)wrecks havoc on critical thinking, prudent projections, and risk management. When the going is good for so long, many are deluded into thinking it'll carry on forever. But it never does.This is the nature of the business cycle. It's been like this since the advent of capitalism. But few industries have indulged in the excesses of The Good Times to the degree of tech in the past decade. Fueled by investors gorging on loss-making moonshots to fight zero or negative interest rates. Now these investors are seeing their bets burn up 70-80-90% of recent-high valuations as they come crashing back to earth. But while the business cycle has many ill effects, it also has redeeming qualities. It clears the brush of dead wood and puts zombie companies out of their misery. If, and only if, it's allowed to do its job. The trouble is when we go too long without a modest burn. The chaparral accumulates, the risks grow larger, so when it finally rips, the consequences turn catastrophic. That just might be where we are right now. It's been a very long time since the tech industry has had to face the full brunt of a business cycle turning south. Even The Great Financial Crisis, as tough as it was, didn't match the dot-com bust for most tech companies. It's impossible to predict how far this financial fire that's just started will spread, but it's prudent to be prepared for a big one. And that'll be a key differentiator between those who get through the next 12-18-24 months with a few scratches and those who'll loose their heads. The preparation for either outcome is being put in now, and that's when the return on those bad habits come to play.

But out of decadence rises redemption: Good times create weak companies. Weak companies create hard times. Hard times create strong companies. As a founder, owner, or executive, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to let these hard times forge a strong company. And to do so without complaining, without blaming. But by taking the steps necessary to meet the challenge. To embrace this crisis and improve the long-term prospects and habits of the business. That's [the ideal of antifragility](https://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto-ebook/dp/B0083DJWGO/). Not merely to withstand hardship, but to become stronger from it. With a leaner organization, with a clearer mission, with stronger fundamentals. Good operators have been deprived this challenge over the past decade of this artificially-juiced economy. Seneca encapsulated this deprivation poetically: I judge you unfortunate because you have never lived through misfortune. You have passed through life without an opponent — no one can ever know what you are capable of, not even you. That doesn't mean it won't be difficult. In fact, it means it'll be all the more difficult because the conditions that are now gone went on for so long, and made so many companies desperately out of shape for the challenge. But today's difficult adjustment for existing companies is also the fertile grounds to grow something new. While existing players wobble about trying to get down to fighting size, anyone starting something new enter the world having known only the current conditions. That's why [so many strong companies emerge from hard times](https://www.businessinsider.com/successful-companies-started-during-past-us-recessions-2020-4). Forced to be prudent, self-sufficient, and focused on getting the basics of the business right quickly, they engrain this ethos in the company. When that's done successfully enough, it'll carry forward even when the hardship is over (but rarely forever). Either way, whether you're having to rejig an existing business to deal with the pressing circumstances or you're starting a new one to take advantage of them, accept your lot. Hell, be thankful for it. Any energy wasted on wishing you could get back what once was is futile. Meet fate with a smile.", "date": "2022-11-28T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

That responsibility means being involved with everything all the time, doing all the work that isn't getting done to your satisfaction of pace and urgency. Those are traps, both of them, that I fall in often. But I have learned to set boundaries around, for example, with things like a commitment to not working more than 40 hours a week on average. There are occasional weeks where I work more and then there are weeks where I work less. But if you take a whole year, it's about 40 hours a week. You just can't do everything, then. Not only is there more than 40 hours a week of work that I could possibly involve myself in, but there's also 120 hours of work a week. There's also 200. There's an unlimited amount of stuff that I could feel like, \"Well, I should do that because I have the obligation to do that.\" Sometimes the responsibility that you hold comes with a serving of just sitting back and shutting the fuck up. Are we on a good path right now? Great. Don't mess with it. Don't tinker with it. Keep your hands off. That's responsibility. Now, this is one of the ways we've essentially institutionalized at 37signals with our way of working, which is something we call Shape Up. Its central thesis is that we work in six-week cycles. At the beginning of a cycle, we'll determine what we should work on. Once we start working on that cycle, we will work on the things we said we were going to work on, and then we will otherwise sit on our damn hands. All the great ideas we're going to come up with, they're not going to just flow into the work right away. They have to wait until it's time to decide again. That level of tying your hand behind your back is a way to fuse responsibility with a reservedness. Not being able to react on every gut instinct of urgency when you get a new idea. The best thing, and I still struggle with this from time to time, the best thing you can do for your team that you're responsible for is to leave them the hell alone. I like to be left alone a lot of the time. So you can combine those things and say like, \"Do you know what? I'm going to step in with responsibility, be part of setting it in direction.\" And once the direction is set, leave the people to simply travel that direction, and then spend the time between checkpoints getting bored, getting creative, coming up with my own damn stuff to do.

Especially if they find themselves accused of being a 'racist' after daring to dissent on any racially-charged topics:We must say no to these people, in quest of a result: An understanding will gradually coalesce among them that they need to step up their game, or, better, step it down. A communal realization will set in, after a while even explicitly acknowledged by its unofficial leaders, that shaming isn’t working anymore. Again, yes, it can be hard to be called a racist even if you know you aren’t one, just as we shudder at the thought of being called pedophiles or climate deniers. It is natural to fear going up against the parishioners who so fervently disagree, with their ten-dollar words and artful sarcasm and air of surety. But I promise you: There is room in this society for speaking the truth and living to tell about it. If you aren't familiar with McWhorter's work, you can start with his short interview on Bill Maher, then proceed to his excellent biweekly appearances with Glenn Loury. His diagnosis of our time is at once piercing and fortifying. He prepares you for the shock that might come from baselessly being called a 'racist' or a 'white supremacist' for the first time. Which can happen easier than you might think, if you, say, dare venture an opinion on the slice of contemporary corporate politics that intersect with race in a way that isn't pre-approved by, as McWhorter labels them, The Elect. He also helps you realize that after the shock of being accused without cause of being a 'racist' or a 'white supremacist' once, it just doesn't have the same effect the next time. The shock value rapidly diminishes exactly because it is such a serious charge. One that can't be sustained if the accusation isn't plugged into reality. Neither with the target or the spectators. I remembered McWhorter's words when someone sent me the following, err, feedback on my post about DEI: There was that indicting label, 'white supremacist', but also the transitive guilt that so often follows it. Anyone associated with the accused is also to be tarred, lest they produce denunciations! Transitive guilt is a terrifying tactic the first time you encounter it. Not only are you being accused of something awful, but the accusation is supercharged to run through your connections to others. People who are likely to be equally mortified, and perhaps even paralyzed, by the second degree charge. So you're not only required to hold your own line, you also have to hold it for everyone else, or you will have brought a pox upon their houses too. No wonder most people don't have the stomach for facing these tactics, and either resign themselves to silence or worse. But that's exactly when they ought to remember McWhorter's words. That by refusing to bow to these tactics, they will inevitably lose their terror. Which was half the point of that DEI analysis. That the power of these tactics has already weakened tremendously since 2020. They've simply been used in vain too many times. This latest reaction is a great example of just that.

Most wisely chose to hold their breath rather than waste it against a hurricane. But since those heady days of 2020, things have changed. The DEI hegemony has gone from virtually unchallenged to come under severe stress. Let's look at four reasons why. First, the Supreme Court is That's not an ideology that holds sway with If the Supreme Court votes with the majority of Americans on this issue of college admissions, it'll be more than a little difficult for major American corporations to continue to run a hiring strategy based on affirmative action. Second, many of the ideological allies of the DEI movement, like the official Black Lives Matter organization, have been This doesn't just involve the Third, the DEI movement has lost control of Twitter, which served as the main instrument to run ideological enforcement in the corporate sphere. The threat of Twitter mobs ensured quick compliance from corporate executives, and other figures of power, lest the pitchforks be aimed at their necks. But Fourth, and finally, is that tech workers – from whom the DEI movement drew its most active and engaged disciples – no longer hold as much power over their place of employment as they once did. Gone are the days where elite tech worker could easily threaten their employer with a jump to a competitor for another plum position making $200K+.

Divorce the specific tactics, and especially Give everyone a fair chance to advance in the world on the merit of their talent and content of their character. Regardless of their identity. That's the creed of equality of opportunity. One that was passed by as the DEI train chased the outcomes-based, ratio-obsessed equality of outcomes. Furthermore, while we refocus on equality of opportunity, we can't put the failure to correct, say, The central premise of DEI, that discrepancies between demography statistics and employment reality, is defacto proof of discrimination is simply false. The sooner this erroneous analysis fade from prominence, the better for all. It's been a crazy couple of years in the throes of zealotry. Most companies and executives could well be excused for ducking their heads during that time, as previous principles of equality were being torched by a radical rebellion raging.

Jordan Peterson, for originally objecting to compelled speech. Kayne West, on accusations of anti-semitism. And finally, now, Elon Musk, for – I think? – buying a troubled social media platform and making changes.Matt Taibbi has an excellent piece comparing this growing thirst for The Current Villain to the puritan witch hunts at the early days of the American colonies. To me, it's also startling how literal the echo of Emmanuel Goldstein from Orwell's too-frequently-quoted book 1984 is. This singular focus on an individual that has to absorb all our hate, our rage, our frustration with reality as we've come to see it.But the larger intellectual framework that can help us explain what the hell is going on with this accelerating thirst for The Current Villain comes from René Girard. He's famous for his work on mimetic theory, which purports that almost all human behavior is guided by copying others. Specifically copying their desires. That we want what we want because others have it. But it's his work on scapegoating that is so fascinating to the analysis of The Current Villain.In the book Wanting, Luke Burgis presents Girard's scapegoating mechanism as a process for discharging group tension. It's a defensive mechanism to prevent all-out internal war by placing all blame for whatever predicament that's creating the group tension on a single individual. The scapegoat selection is performed as follows:Scapegoats are often insiders who are perceived to violate the group’s orthodoxy or taboos. Their behavior makes them appear as a threat to the group’s unity. They come to be seen as cancers or monstrous outsiders who have violated or destroyed the social bonds that hold the group together. Eliminating the scapegoat is the act through which the group becomes unified again. Nobody is safe from being made into a scapegoat. During a mimetic crisis, perception is distorted.. even the smallest differences are amplified. People project their worst fears onto a scapegoat rather than face the crisis head-on. Nobody wants to pay the price. If that doesn't describe our current social-media fueled quest for reputational sacrifice, I don't know what does. Especially for characters like Dave Chapelle, Kayne West, or Elon Musk. Individuals who were all seen as insiders in good standing until they violated a taboo, and then became the object of overwhelming animosity, as a mob formed to discharge the unresolved crisis over, say, trans issues or censorship issues. Burgis' continues: The scapegoating mechanism does not hinge on the guilt or innocence of the scapegoat. It hinges on the ability of a community to use a scapegoat to accomplish their desired outcome: unification, healing, purgation, expiation. The scapegoat serves a religious function. Girard's scapegoating mechanism recognizes that the human sacrifices made to dissolve the tension often wouldn't really fix the underlying issue. Frequently, it would just be a release valve, but then the tension would slowly start to build up again, and thus require another sacrificial scapegoat later. That feels key to understanding the acceleration we're currently living through. The scapegoats barely release any tension any more, especially since the shift from the early day of cancel culture that focused on minor characters with limited power to resist the mob, to major characters who can actually fight back. So the underlying questions on, say, trans or censorship issues remain unanswered and unresolved. Thus mobs form with ever greater frequency and ferocity in ever-more desperate attempts to dissolve the tension and restore unification. But it's just not working, no matter how vicious the prosecution of each campaign becomes, no matter how much the bar is lowered for qualifying transgressions. So that's the diagnosis, but what's the prescription? How do we get out of this mimetic cycle of scapegoating? Ironically, given Musk's role as The Current Villain, it might just be if we sacrifice the entertainment of the colosseum. If Musk somehow does manage to destroy the worst mimetic amplifier of our day, Twitter, we might see some actual release of tension. At least for a while. Short of that, Girard offers that the last time we saw a real shift in scapegoating dynamics was when the crucifixion of Christ gave us the perspective of the victim through the gospels of Christianity: \"Let he who is without sin throw the first stone!\". So I guess all we need to resolve the situation is the second coming of Christ? Let me say a little prayer.", "date": "2022-11-16T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Here are a few: The Covid Misinformation perpetrated on Joe Rogan's podcast? It seems like ages ago, but in fact it was just this January! And okay, it also wasn't all the noble people. Mainly just a couple of old musicians, like Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, who for a moment relived the glory days of the world's attention, as they hammered Spotify for their awful, awful decision to let a popular podcaster have outlawed conversations on outlawed topics. In defiance of The Science and official consensus on Covid!! Young and Mitchell removed their music from the Swedish streaming service on perhaps the greatest ever rebel ultimatum: Spotify, you must compel Joe Rogan to cite the official line on Covid in all its forms or we will stop rockin' in the free world! But after the high of the media circus died down, it was hard for most of the musicians who had followed Neil Young off the platform to stick to their convictions. It didn't take long for most of them to return to the service. The grand concession that Spotify offered to appease the grandiose demand that it's \"Me or Joe Rogan!\"? That the company would plaster any podcast that seemingly even mentions the pandemic in passing with a bright blue warning label that links to The Official Take on everything that's Correct and True about Covid. That's how I was reminded about all this nonsense in the first place. I went to Rogan's page on Spotify because I had caught a clip online from his interview with Graham Hancock, and I was curious to hear more. The most visually compelling element of that page is the repeating blue warning bars on nearly every episode. Whether it is a conversation with a fellow comedian, a musician, a scientist, or a journalist, the blue bar beacons about the supposed dangers that might lurk from Covid talk inside these free-flowing conversations. So I clicked \"Learn more\" on the blue bar, which took me to a COVID-19 Guide where the first and most prominent link is to this page at the CDC: COVID-19 Vaccination Clinical & Professional Resources. From there, you currently find a barrage of pleas to vaccinate kids as young as 6 months old, booster shots for 5 year olds, and the claim that \"children from certain racial and ethnic minority groups are.. more likely to become sick or die from COVID-19\". In other words, a huge push to get infants, toddlers, kids, and teenagers vaccinated and boosted. Especially if they're of color. That's odd, I thought. Why on earth is Spotify, a Swedish streaming service, defacto promoting Covid vaccines to infants and toddlers, when the Swedish government already decided, around the same time the freakout over Rogan was at its peak, that even recommending the vaccine to kids under 12 wasn't going to be on the menu? In Denmark, the health authorities, which have widely been recognized as having done an excellent job during Covid, also decided over the summer not even to offer the option of a vaccine to kids under 18! And currently only offers booster shots to adults over 50, or people who are immunocompromised. In Norway, the health authorities went out in January as well with a message that \"COVID-19 is rarely harmful for children\" and \"having COVID-19 gives as good protection as the vaccine against reinfection\". No recommendation to vaccinate kids here either. So a unified Scandinavia has decided that pushing vaccines on kids as a matter of policy just doesn't make sense. The risks don't outweigh the benefits. Besides, most of these kids have had the virus anyway, and are thus well protected going forward. That is a very different stance to what the CDC continues to push as The Science. So again, why is Spotify still trying to appease the likes of Young or Mitchell with these alarming blue warning bars pointing to information counter to that of health authorities in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark? Because Covid in America remains a political struggle rather than a medical one, of course. A flame that continues to attract partisan moths. Despite an absolute embarrassment of specific calls that were at one time or another held by The Consensus of The Science turning out to be bunk. Does anyone need a reminder? Here are a few: Masks don't work against Covid. No, wait, they actually do, and it doesn't even matter which type you use! So please ensure that your toddler's cloth mask is on at all time in kindergarten. Sorry, what we meant was that only N95+ masks do anything, and that you indeed can't make a toddler consistently wear a properly protecting mask, and if you do, you're hurting the child's ability to connect and learn. The virus can get you anywhere! So don't go to the beach! Make sure that kids are sitting properly separated outside in silence and the freezing cold as they eat their lunch. Oh, actually, we meant that being outside is actually very safe, and policing the beaches didn't do anything to stem transmission. But at least kids won't be harmed by long lockdowns, they're resilient! Well, okay, no, many of them are now way below grade level! Oh, and their mental health absolutely cratered from the isolation experiment. Wups! If you get the vaccine, you won't transmit the disease to others. Oh, sorry, I guess you actually can. But at least if you got the virus, you will be protected against contracting the virus again. Well, okay, no, but then at least for a long time. Sorry, by \"long time\", we mean a few months, but then you can get a booster! You should just keep getting boosters. This will be like a flu shot, something you get every year. Sorry, actually, after several boosters, the effect of subsequent ones is now seriously in doubt. The AstraZeneca vaccine is perfectly safe! There's nothing at all to worry about! Oh, sorry, several women died in Denmark due to a rare but fatal side effect. So the Danish health authorities stopped using AstraZeneca altogether, and so too did the Norwegians. The lab leak theory is a slanderous conspiracy! How dare you suggest that China isn't telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about a virus that has devasted the world? What possible incentive could they have in being less than forthcoming about the sloppy gain-of-function research being conducted at the Wuhan lab? Oh, heh, sorry, actually now it appears that the lab leak theory is looking quite plausible. Sorry for banning discussion about this as a conspiracy theory! Our bad! That's just a small slice of the countless twists and turns we went through trying to understand Covid-19 and the pandemic it caused. A journey of zig-zagging discovery that ought to have provoked more than just a little hesitation in those eagerly attempting to police any opposition to the temporary conclusions of The Science. Especially since so many of those early conclusions turned out to be wrong! That's of course how lowercase science works. It produces hypotheses, which are subjected to the real world, and their ability to be disproven is literally the most important part of the process! If a hypothesis doesn't offer room for falsification, it's just not scientific. This falsification process relies on vigorous cross-examination of the evidence. On counter-arguments that may themselves be flawed or wrong, but which test the hypothesis under review. If they fail to rebut, the hypothesis is strengthened, but if they succeed, we have to get back to the drawing board. Capitalizing The Science and turning it into a consensus cult has done more to undermine public trust in the House of Francis Bacon than even the atom bomb. It's cracked the reputation of scientists who turned dogmatists, and centers for disease control and prevention captured by political directives. It's brought eternal shame on musicians turned narrative cops, and the journalists that breathlessly backed the censorship protocol that was installed at the outset of this pandemic. No wonder there's a plea emerging for us all to just forget about the whole thing! Who could have known, right?! When we called Rogan a fascist science denier for daring to question whether imposing an experimental new vaccine on everyone and their children, it was all in good faith, so now that the science has proven much of that bunk, I think it's best we just Forget & Forgive! Move on! Nothing to see! Now I'm actually oddly enough inclined to agree. The world has been torn asunder by extremist convictions of the righteous way. The counter force to this might well actually be forgiveness. I choose to believe that many of the people who went totalitarian did so in good faith, or that it at least started there. But this only works if the lesson that The Science is not truth is integrated fully. That it's a process for discovering and refining the truth, not the truth itself. It's a process that often ends down blind alleys, and has to backtrack. A process that desperately needs the voice of an opposition to test, validate, and properly authenticate knowledge. A lot to ask, I know, but could we at least start by having Spotify remove those ridiculous blue warning labels from every damn conversation Joe Rogan has that mentions the word Covid?", "date": "2022-11-14T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Why didn't you just raise a bunch of venture capital and go for The Big Time? Why were you taking profits when you could have invested in growth? Don't you want to own a unicorn? Don't you want to be a billionaire?! This is the Silicon Valley way. Ride the big money to the moon or die trying. Anyone interested in living on earth just don't have the vision or the courage to reach for infinity and beyond. Operating within your means, taking profits along the way, and aiming for a stable, long-term business is not just dismissed, but frowned upon. The logic of venture capital is to rush every business it touches through a steroid program that accepts a mortality rate of up to 90%. All it needs is one moon shot out of ten to hit escape velocity, and the fund will be golden. But golden for whom? For how long? The venture capitalists who invested in Asana, Monday.com, and Smartsheet surely all made out like bandits when these unprofitable software companies went public. Now every single one of these stocks is getting destroyed in the public market, as investors sour on the idea of them losing hundreds of millions of dollars every year chasing growth with no prospect of profits in sight. Asana lost an incredible $285m in 2021, $210m in 2020, and $118m in 2019. They're on track to losing even more with over $370m in losses booked for the trailing twelve months. That's closing in on a billion dollars in losses over the last four years. Madness. To use the glib insult that we've also enjoyed receiving over the years: They make fucking todo lists!! Beyond the madness, there's a real question as to how long losses like that can continue. It appears they're down to just $238m in cash on hand, which wouldn't even be enough runway for another year at the current loss-rate. No wonder the stock has been absolutely crushed. Over the past year, it's down a catastrophic 87%. That's dot-bomb levels of bad. And where is relief going to come from? 17% of the stock is held by shorts. Will Asana raise more capital with new issues at these levels, and essentially wipe out the investors who went in just a little while ago? Interest rates aren't about to let up any time soon either, and everyone is predicting the economy will get worse in 2023. It's ugly. Not just ugly for investors either. But for employees too who will have seen their stock-based compensation crater – every option or warrant they might have minted since they went public would be worthless – and now have to expect that their job might be on the chopping block too, if losses have to be trimmed. And of course customers might too be worried that with the stock getting wiped out, the company could become a take-over target for any of the bigger players, like Microsoft or Salesforce. Some of them might remember what happened last time Microsoft bought a todo-list maker: It was eventually shutdown, the service stopped working, and everyone was asked to use some other Microsoft todo product instead. Eeeks. Now you might say the market is hurting as a whole, and that's certainly true. But the pain is not equally distributed. Yes, Dropbox is down 21% over the past year, even Apple is down 6%, but Box is up 5% over the period. It's a mixed bag to be sure, but it's been absolute murder for the likes of Asana, Monday.com, and Smartsheet. You might also say that while stocks go up and down, the business behind needn't suffer from the swings. And that's true as long as the company doesn't need to rely on the stock price to raise more money, pay employees, or pursue acquisitions. If you're just trotting along making money, paying employees with cash, and completing acquisitions without using the stock, you can ignore the market swings for long stretches of time. That's just not the reality for any of these companies. The bloodshed isn't constrained to the public markets either. You can be sure that any private company that raised money using public comps from late 2021 are going to be in a world of hurt, if they're also wildly unprofitable, and eventually in need of raising more money. Look at ClickUp, for example. They raised a $400m Series C on Oct 27, 2021 at a $4 billion valuation. October was near that top-of-market moment. The investors who got in at that time need not just a moonshot to be made whole but for the company reach the outer rings of Orion. Incredible if they can pull it off, highly unlikely. And in the mean time, all the same public-market pressures are coming to bear on them as a private company saddled with an absurd valuation and a burn-rate to match. Employees who were issued stock at the last valuation probably shouldn't plan to pay for retirement with the proceeds. Or look at Airtable. They raised an insane $735m Series F on Dec 13, 2021 at a $12 billion valuation!! Bringing the entire funding journey to $1.4 billion. What might that all look like if they face a Asana-like -87% for investors, employees, and options to raise more money later? Same deal with Notion. They raised a $343M Series C on Oct 8, 2021 at $10 billion in valuation. These are all crazy numbers from a crazy time, and now the economic hangover is due. Jason and I have lived through many of these boom'n'bust cycles. 37signals was founded during the original dot-com boom, survived through the bust, since through the financial crisis, and every downturn since and in-between. In this time, we've seen competitors come and go. Fantastical valuations inflate and deflate. People thinking they were billionaires one moment, only to be left with little to keep the next. This recession isn't going to last forever, but it's also barely even begun! We haven't even begun to feel the hurt in the industry at large from the excessive exuberance that propelled the madness of the last few years. The fallout is not contained. The situation is not transitory. But amongst all this misery, there's also opportunity. Opportunity to start and grow businesses based on sustainable thinking of profitability. Or at least an aspiration to getting there in less time than it took to build the pyramids. You don't need to sign up for whole or half billion dollar losses over four years to have a shoot at building something awesome, something you can be proud of. Now is the time to RECONSIDER. Not just for the entrepreneurs who aspire to build, but also to employees thinking about where to join, and for the customers who don't want to be collateral damage in another dot-bomb implosion.", "date": "2022-11-09T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

That's good. Because at least some decisions will be made too. We'll fix them... But I think it's so much better than where things were not very long ago. Does this situation remind you of anything topical? I'm not saying that Elon Musk is Steve Jobs. I'm not saying Twitter is about to post an Apple-like turn-around bull run. But I am saying that the call to urgency, the focus on the customer, and the willingness to start making decisions knowing some of them will be wrong is uncannily similar. So too is the response from the press. While everyone seems to be collectively losing their shit right now over Elon's staff cuts, it's worth hearing the echo from Jobs' return back then. Here's ZDNet begrudgingly recognizing the early results of the dramatic cuts that Jobs' had instituted with a dire warning about the future: First, Apple has lost a lot of sterling engineering talent that will be hard to replace. Second, Apple has lost a lot of sterling sales and marketing talent (don't laugh) that will be hard to replace. And the company still lacks a marketing chief. Third, Apple has lost a lot of sterling operations talent that will be hard to replace... Net-net on the lost staffing issue, then, Apple has some seriously shaky time ahead of it. Yes, times were shaky, because Apple needed to be woken up. It needed a fundamental reboot, and Steve Jobs delivered just that. It required some savage cuts to the payroll, to the project portfolio, and to the pride of the company. But the alternative was more of the same, and the same clearly wasn't working.

And by fixed, I mean be a place where people enjoy hanging out, where the debate over content moderation is settled, and where Elon Musk might make his money back. Easy peasy then! To start, here's my fundamental premise: The internet is full of the bland, the wonderful, the obscure, the sacrilegious, the offensive, the infuriating, and the nasty. The internet, as a whole, is governed by local laws on speech, not by a council of global content moderators, not by single individuals. This is a feature not a bug. An American can sue another American under US defamation laws for stuff posted on the internet. But the Thai government won't get an American extradited under its lèse-majesté laws if that person offends the country's monarch on the internet. Restrictions on speech are based on jurisdictions (and Twitter is thankfully liable in one of most liberal speech jurisdictions around). This is also a feature not a bug. Twitter should embrace these features, and accept its role as a fundamental protocol. Just like HTTP, just like SMTP, just like FTP. All protocols that can be used to transmit all sorts of disagreeable content, but where the moderation of said content is left to individuals, not some all-knowing overlords. This isn't possible today because Twitter shoves so much speech in front of you that you never asked to see. It allows strangers to invade popular threads with no protections available to the original author. You know that you can find the most vile, nasty shit on the internet if you search for the right words on Google. So most people just don't do that! They manage their own exposure by moderating their own behavior. This is again a feature, not a bug. This could be Twitter! If Twitter stopped shoving all this speech you never asked to see in front of you, there would be no need for an army of content moderators. The internet at large is not filtered through such an army, and it's all the better for it. Governments keep trying to impose such a filter, but so far only the most authoritarian regimes have succeeded (and up until a few minutes ago, there was broad consensus in the Western world that this was bad). This would mean that Twitter would have to change in a few fundamental ways: To start, here's my fundamental premise: The internet is full of the bland, the wonderful, the obscure, the sacrilegious, the offensive, the infuriating, and the nasty.

This would mean that Twitter would have to change in a few fundamental ways: - Only speech from people you've asked to follow should appear in your feed. If any of those people post something disagreeable to your tastes, you can moderate that content by unfollowing them. - Authors should be deputized as content moderators of their own posts. Just like someone hosting a blog with comments on the internet is. You can either say you don't want comments at all, that comments need to be pre-approved, that you'll remove the bad ones, or that you'll just let it flow. - All the promoted tweets that Twitter wants to showcase to the world should pass through a positive rather than negative editorial process. Meaning Twitter employees pick what they like to feature rather than ban what they don't. Thus, like the internet at large, everyone gets to control the kind of speech they're exposed to. Different people will come to different conclusions on the kind speech they wish to be exposed to. This is the fundamental wisdom of the infamous Section 230 protection that has allowed the internet as we know it to exist. This curation should be something you can outsource to trusted delegates. Let me experience Twitter as a list of authors and threads maintained by someone I trust. It'll also mean, like the internet at large, that you'll be able to find Bad Words, Terrible Words, No Good Words, if you deliberately seek them out. Twitter will serve as a portal to this in the same way Google does. These words may be hurtful or harmful. But all the content moderators in the world couldn't put the utopia that a platform for hundreds of millions won't contain disagreeable speech together again. Accept that reality. Accept that the price we pay for an open, free internet is one which permits the darker sides of humanity. Lean on the local jurisdictions and laws, democratically controlled as they are, to police this reality like we've done with that beautiful bastard that is the internet.

Of course you can pickup on the subtleties of a well-run organization, but it's far more memorable to deal with the chaos and aggravation that comes from working in a mad house. I was very fortunate to have plenty of bad bosses early on in my career. Bosses who instilled in me an urge to operate differently. These were often people who had themselves been deprived of experience working for other bad bosses in the same industry. And thus couldn't relate to how their decisions would manifest for the people they were responsible for. One of those early, defining experiences involved the seating arrangement at a company in Copenhagen back in the dot-com heydays. One day, the boss decided we should change how we were sitting, so as to create a more 'dynamic' office aesthetic (especially to visiting investors). That meant round tables in open rooms where some would sit with their back to people passing by. Thus creating a fishbowl experience where anyone walking behind them could see whatever was on their screen at the time. I hated it. It left me with a revulsion to dictating the physical working environment of others on the basis of vanity, especially if the boss wasn't willing to abide themselves. And if I ever got to call the shots somewhere, I'd make damn sure that people were free to work where and how they saw fit. Now I'm sure I've made decisions over the years as a boss that those working for me would characterize as bad. It's inevitable that different people will perceive the work environment differently. So I hope that perception at least serves as a spark for some of them to start their own businesses from chiseled principles that were carved in opposition. Everyone deserves at least a few bad bosses in their career to teach them what not to do, illuminate what really matters to them, and hopefully endow them with a perspective on how they'd operate themselves if they ever got the chance.

Twitter now belongs to Elon Musk. And I must admit that I'm softening on the prospect. I still think social media by and large operate to the detriment of society, but I don't see Twitter aggravating that under Musk's management. But we shall see! That's the excitement of our time. So many unknowns up in the air.What's perhaps less of a surprise is the reaction from some of Twitter's employees. Now clearly they've been on a roller coaster since the spring, and such a ride might mess with the composure of even the most stoic among us. But that does not make the demands expressed in [this open letter](https://time.com/6224380/elon-musk-twitter-open-letter/?utm_source=substack&utm;_medium=email)reported by TIME any less delusional.It opens with a charming overture to the new owner of their company: A threat to workers at Twitter is a threat to Twitter’s future. These threats have an impact on us as workers and demonstrate a fundamental disconnect with the realities of operating Twitter. They threaten our livelihoods, access to essential healthcare, and the ability for visa holders to stay in the country they work in. We cannot do our work in an environment of constant harassment and threats. Without our work, there is no Twitter. We, the workers at Twitter, will not be intimidated. We recommit to supporting the communities, organizations, and businesses who rely on Twitter. We will not stop serving the public conversation. Threats? Harassment? Intimidation? You'd think they were giving an account of working for the mob. Not the reality of being highly-paid tech workers at an unprofitable social media platform that just got a new owner who bought the place to turn the ship around. Again, you should read this with the sympathy appropriate for people whose place of employment has been sold-then-not-sold-then-sold-again seemingly ad nauseam this year. But that's not a free pass to throw entitled tantrums or demands. Yet that's what we got. The open letter continues with these points: We demand leadership to respect the platform and the workers who maintain it by committing to preserving the current headcount. We demand Elon Musk explicitly commit to preserve our benefits, those both listed in the merger agreement and not (e.g. remote work). We demand to be treated with dignity, and to not be treated as mere pawns in a game played by billionaires. This is not just a delusional list, but also a self-defeating negotiation tactic. The Twitter employees who conceived of this letter have little to no leverage. Musk has demonstrated repeatedly that he's not the type of character to be pushed like this. But take Musk out of the picture for a second. What new owner, especially one who just massively overpaid for a company that's been losing hundreds of millions of dollars lately, would commit not to layoff a single employee? Or agree to be bound in all perpetuity by the benefits and work arrangements offered by the past management? The whole point of Musk buying the Twitter was to run it differently! That's what the $44 billion offer yield in return: The power to make new plans for the company. Who knows what Musk actually intends to do. Maybe he'll let go of 75% of employees, maybe it'll be 50%, but I guarantee you that there's no possible universe in which the number is zero. Anyway. Even going down this line of analysis, thinking of the open letter as an earnest attempt to negotiate working conditions with the new owner, is a bit folly. Much easier to explain the delusional demands as performance theater. Acting out the righteous belief that We, The Twitter Workers, Stand United Before The Great Peril. Whatever happens to Twitter, I must nod in awe of Musk's ability to direct one of the most fascinating shows on earth right now, and this little scene with the delusional demands fits right in.

This is the mass surveillance regime that Snowden revealed to the world back in 2013, and one that largely continues to this day (despite minor amendments on the program's ability to spy on Americans). This regime is propped up by mechanisms like Those mass surveillance mechanisms don't care in the slightest where the data is physically located. They only care about who controls the data, and whether those entities can be compelled to comply with US law, which sanctions this spying game. If you're a European company having your email hosted by Microsoft, the FISA court won't care one iota whether the physical email data resides in Redmond or Rotterdam. All it'll care about is whether it can compel Microsoft to let it snoop, and it can, because Microsoft is a US company, and that's really the end of that! No amount of indirection with server placement, legal structures, or other shell games will keep US intelligence services out of your data, if they want in. Thus, it is Now I fully understand why European companies and their American vendors have been keen to find a way to pretend to comply with the ruling without actually complying with the ruling. Because complying in full is essentially an outright ban on European companies using American internet services to store or process their data. It would erect a great privacy wall between Europe and America, which would keep out vast amounts of commerce, in order to protect Europeans from the American intelligence services. And in typical European fashion, the ruling, and the popular interpretations of the ruling, was coy about these obvious implications. It simply shifted the burden of arriving at the logical conclusion – a ban on most American internet services – onto individual companies. Which created a feast for lawyers all over Europe to concoct bespoke analysis and mitigation strategies on matters that should have been clear and universal. It was European bureaucracy at its worst. But also European principles at their best! The European Court of Justice must have known that their verdict would be an earthquake for commerce, yet they chose to make it anyway, in respect to higher principles. Leaving both European companies and politicians in the awkward position of figuring out the details from that. We looked into all these issues at length when Now the executive functions in the US and Europe have come up with Privacy Shield 2.0 called the In other words, it's another awkward piece of indirection that's highly unlikely to pass muster with the European Court of Justice. But because the wheels of justice turn so slowly with that court, it'll probably offer enough of a pretend cover for many years to come, so Europeans can continue using American services. While American intelligence services continue their mass surveillance regime with the same justification of fighting terrorism as it ever did. So now we have another wink-wink-nod-nod attempt to pretend to comply with the original Schrems II ruling. One which invalidates the millions of billable hours invoiced by lawyers trying to find a bespoke way out of the uncertain liability since 2020. Brilliant. The perfect illustration of our age of bullshit jobs. Meanwhile the real winners here are the companies that never bothered to engage in the charade to comply, the lawyers that played their expensive parts in the charade that was performed, and the American data spies who never skipped a byte. The best part of it all is that we'll probably get a chance to repeat this dance in 2029, or whenever the European Court of Justice rules again. Get your tickets now for Schrems III: Bottomline: American companies will never be able to resist the demands of American intelligence services. It doesn't matter if their servers are located in Virginia or Paris or on the damn moon. Europe should either come to terms with that reality or raise a real privacy wall despite the costs. But until Europe makes up its mind, European companies would be smart to ignore the whole charade. Like most of them have done anyway.", "date": "2022-10-28T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

We've run extensively in both Amazon's cloud and Google's cloud. We've run on bare virtual machines, we've run on Kubernetes. We've seen all the cloud has to offer, and tried most of it. It's finally time to conclude: Renting computers is (mostly) a bad deal for medium-sized companies like ours with stable growth. The savings promised in reduced complexity never materialized. So we're making our plans to leave. The cloud excels at two ends of the spectrum, where only one end was ever relevant for us. The first end is when your application is so simple and low traffic that you really do save on complexity by starting with fully managed services. This is the shining path that Heroku forged, and the one that has since been paved by Render and others. It remains a fabulous way to get started when you have no customers, and it'll carry you quite far even once you start having some. (Then you'll later be faced with a Good Problem once the bills grow into the stratosphere as usage picks up, but that's a reasonable trade-off.) The second is when your load is highly irregular. When you have wild swings or towering peaks in usage. When the baseline is a sliver of your largest needs. Or when you have no idea whether you need ten servers or a hundred. There's nothing like the cloud when that happens, like we learned when launching HEY, and suddenly 300,000 users signed up to try our service in three weeks instead of our forecast of 30,000 in six months. But neither of those two conditions apply to us today. They never did for Basecamp. Yet by continuing to operate in the cloud, we're paying an at times almost absurd premium for the possibility that it could. It's like paying a quarter of your house's value for earthquake insurance when you don't live anywhere near a fault line. Yeah, sure, if somehow a quake two states over opens the earth so wide it cracks your foundation, you might be happy to have it, but it doesn't feel proportional, does it? Let's take HEY as an example. We're paying over half a million dollars per year for database (RDS) and search (ES) services from Amazon. Yes, when you're processing email for many tens of thousands of customers, there's a lot of data to analyze and store, but this still strikes me as rather absurd. Do you know how many insanely beefy servers you could purchase on a budget of half a million dollars per year? Now the argument always goes: Sure, but you have to manage these machines! The cloud is so much simpler! The savings will all be there in labor costs! Except no. Anyone who thinks running a major service like HEY or Basecamp in the cloud is \"simple\" has clearly never tried. Some things are simpler, others more complex, but on the whole, I've yet to hear of organizations at our scale being able to materially shrink their operations team, just because they moved to the cloud. It was a wonderful marketing coup, though. Sold with analogies like \"well you don't run your own powerplant either, do you?\" or \"are infrastructure services really your core competency?\". Then lathered up with a thick coat of NEW-NEW-NEW paint, and The Cloud has beamed so brightly only the luddites would consider running their own servers in its shadow. Meanwhile Amazon in particular is printing profits renting out servers at obscene margins. AWS' profit margin is almost 30% ($18.5b in profits on $62.2B in revenue), despite huge investments in future capacity and new services. This margin is bound to soar now that \"the firm said it plans to extend the useful life of its servers from four years to five, and its networking equipment from five years to six in the future\". Which is fine! Of course it's expensive to rent your computers from someone else. But it's never presented in those terms. The cloud is sold as computing on demand, which sounds futuristic and cool, and very much not like something as mundane as \"renting computers\", even though that's mostly what it is. But this isn't just about cost. It's also about what kind of internet we want to operate in the future. It strikes me as downright tragic that this decentralized wonder of the world is now largely operating on computers owned by a handful of mega corporations. If one of the primary AWS regions go down, seemingly half the internet is offline along with it. This is not what DARPA designed! Thus I consider it a duty that we at 37signals do our part to swim against the stream. We have a business model that's incredibly compatible with owning hardware and writing it off over many years. Growth trajectories that are mostly predictable. Expert staff who might as well employ their talents operating our own machines as those belonging to Amazon or Google. And I think there are plenty of other companies in similar boats. But before we more broadly can set sail back towards lower-cost and decentralized shores, we need to turn rudder of our collective conversation away from the cloud-serving marketing nonsense about running your own powerplant. Up until very recently, everyone ran their own servers, and much of the progress in tooling that enabled the cloud is available for your own machines as well. Don't let the entrenched cloud interests dazzle you into believing that running your own setup is too complicated. Everyone and their dog did it to get the internet off the ground, and it's only gotten easier since. It's time to part the clouds and let the internet shine through.

I'm less enthralled with some of the particulars of capitalized Open Source movement, which at times seem obsessed with the same scarcity mentality that runs the commercial branch of our industry. One of those times is right now with the fight over GitHub's Copilot AI. I captured the problem with scarcity scarecrows in Open Source in the treatise Then checkout the announcement of this new investigation, and see if you can't spot some of the many scarcity scarecrows it employs. Here are a few choice bits: I captured the problem with scarcity scarecrows in Open Source in the treatise I won't let you pay me for my open source a few years ago, so if you care about the recently announced investigation into a potential lawsuit against Microsoft over GitHub's Copilot AI, you might want to give it a read.Then checkout the announcement of this new investigation, and see if you can't spot some of the many scarcity scarecrows it employs. Here are a few choice bits: By offering Copilot as an alternative interface to a large body of open-source code, Microsoft is doing more than severing the legal relationship between open-source authors and users. Arguably, Microsoft is creating a new walled garden that will inhibit programmers from discovering traditional open-source communities. Or at the very least, remove any incentive to do so. Over time, this process will starve these communities. User attention and engagement will be shifted into the walled garden of Copilot and away from the open-source projects themselves—away from their source repos, their issue trackers, their mailing lists, their discussion boards. This shift in energy will be a painful, permanent loss to open source. This is classic zero-sum thinking. The kind that open source at its best transcends for me, and Open Source at its worst entrenches. First of all, I can't even recognize the logical steps toward this dire conclusion of a painful, permanent loss to open source. Because someone can autocomplete a method or even a class, we're going to lose open source communities, where people collaborate on shared software, report bugs, and build on each others' work? How? Half the end-user benefit of using open source software is to participate in a long-run relationship of practitioners who collaborate on continued improvement of said software. How does getting a one-off snapshot, tailored with AI to your particulars, in any way undermine this? Second of all, GitHub's Copilot AI is in my opinion exactly the kind of collaborative, innovative breakthrough that I'm thrilled so see any open source code that I put into the world used to enable. Isn't this partly why we share our code to begin with? To enable others to remix, reuse, and regenerate with? It certainly is key amongst my reasons. There's a funny mirror version of this investigation that looks an awfully lot like Oracle's tragic attempt to copyright the Java APIs. To use the law to lock critical software into this dungeon of scarcity thinking. Aren't these the demons we in the open source community were meant to be fighting rather than become? You don't even have to like or use Copilot to be troubled by this investigation into the legitimacy of its existence. If we seek to indict how AI might enable us to engage with the body of open source code, why stop at the AI level? Should we also indict CDNs that compile JavaScript libraries into resources that can be pulled over the internet without ever visiting the project homepage? Or bundled packages of any kind? If it's the intermediation that brings forth the froth, there are many other forms that we might suddenly start to suspect. These are the ways of closed software. The greed with which free use is often curtailed, unless it's explicitly allowed. As a maker of both commercial and open source software, I understand the need to protect the rights of the former. But that's exactly why I also choose to invest my time in the latter as well. To escape this trap of hoarding positive rights, lest someone, somewhere, might get away with some inspired feat of unauthorized creativity that builds upon my work. Now I accept that reasonable people can draw different conclusions on the Copilot AI. And of course that reasonable open source creators can create for different reasons. But I still think it's more than worth our time to critically and repeatedly question this scarcity mindset that at times overpowers the virtues of sharing in Open Source. And at least make a point to opt out of this brigade, if one is summoned in your name, when all you want is to write software, share it freely, and see humanity prosper broadly as a result.", "date": "2022-10-18T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

I can't recommend it highly enough. But if you want an even briefer introduction to the part that pertains to this discussion, Jordan Peterson has an This yearning for an identity- defining struggle is so great that humans will invent one if need be. Our current culture is overrun with such imaginary struggles on all sides. Bredding pathological attacks on the pillars of society, and It's also likely a key factor in why some of the cultural battles long since won still have outposts insisting we keep up the fight. Like the whole discussion about Covid, continued masking, and vaccinations in the US. Many European countries moved on from that in the beginning of the year, and the rest not long after. Yet the cultural skirmish around this question in the US still has outposts putting up the appearance of an existential fight, as those last Japanese islands after WWII had long ended. Much of that longing for a struggle is subconscious, obviously. Manifesting itself in actions, but not in realizations. But there are also the overt confessions for participation in a struggle. Casey Neistat accounts his own The fascinating thing is that the search for a unique struggle is always ongoing. As the current When you look at the whole sum of it all, it's hard not to have the thought that we were broadly better off when the big, existential struggles were derived mostly from religious roleplaying. That the human need for a struggle might well have been better contained and channeled through universal religions with a predefined cast of supernatural characters, saints, parables, and purpose. That without a broad religious operating system, we end up chasing the same bugs in our innate psyche, but the modern fixes are often way worse. In fact, it's a bit like the continued marveling at the pyramids. Our understanding of how exactly these majestic structures were built remain surprisingly poor. But the achievement is no less irrefutable. The big world religions that drove civilization forward (and at times held it back!) are poorly understood in their specific effects at the societal level, and we're only now beginning to see full consequences of their retreat. Thomas Sowell makes this point about tradition, culture, and law in the book We live in strange times. It's hard to get a handle on what's up or down. But you could do much worse trying than by reading Orwell, Dostoevsky, and Sowell. Then thinking hard and long about how to guide your perhaps DNA-programmed yearning for a struggle towards something that won't tear down the pillars of civilization.

But chances are far better that the rainbow springs straight out of a dumpster than a pot of gold, and that the mission statement is trash too. But what's the harm, you might say? So it's a bland bucket of corporatese about putting customers first, striving for excellence, and thinking long term, but aren't those worthwhile goals to at least attempt to reach for? No. No, they are not. That's because these mission statements – that never contain neither a real mission nor any interesting statements – involve no trade-offs, and thus offer no guidance. A mission statement that actually said 'fuck the customers, we strive for mediocrity, and this is all about the short term'? Now that would be worth printing. Waxing lyrically about all the happy customers, the happy employees, and all the other win-win bullshit is placing a bet you can only lose. Zero upside, unlimited downside. When customers invariably are disgruntled, they'll point to your saccharine mission statement and not just feel aggrieved, but betrayed. You promised!! And for all the customers who are happy, or, as is the case with 97% of all commerce, merely content? They're just meeting the bar you set for yourself. No cake, no balloons. The mission statement is setting every company that posts one up to fail. It creates an impossible ideal crafted in an abstract world that has no bearing on reality.

So on a recent holiday, I banished it completely for a week, while reading Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport. That felt great. But as Newport notes, it's easy to fall back into bad old habits, if all you do is a sabbatical from your phone. His book details a bunch of good remedies, but one approach I've found especially effective since returning to daily life has been to essentially remove all apps from the Home Screen. Mine now looks like this: I do have other apps on my phone, but starting any of them now requires pulling down from the top to reveal the search area. I then type the name of the app, and just start that: This setup accomplishes several things. First, it adds friction to any use of the phone beyond the most basic, like messaging with my wife, or making a phone call. Any use that's actually worth doing is easily worth the friction, but any frivolous use now faces a helpful hurdle to deter it. Second, I no longer open my phone to do one thing, then get dragged into a muscle-memory tour of other apps while I'm there. It's far easier to simple do the thing I desired to do, then put the phone away, when I'm literally staring into the cosmos after completing any single task. The photos app is there as a form of digital metadone. If old habits overcome my intentions, and I frivolously reach for the phone to kill a moment, the only slot machine available on the first row is my personal photo album. If you long-press on the Photos app, you'll get the option to see pictures from One Year Ago. So I'll do that, enjoy 5-10 photos, usually of my family, or racing, or traveling, from a year ago, and that'll be that. There's no forever scrolling feed of novelty that can suck me in for hours on end. Just a small slice of happy memories. While this has been working really well so far, Newport is right to note that escaping the phone addiction takes more than just a quick or clever hack. You have to replace the time spent using the phone with better alternatives. So this is hardly The One Thing Silicon Valley Doesn't Want You To Know, but it's a help and a start.

Acting on the knowledge that someone isn't working out is probably the hardest task for any conscientious manager. It's only natural to meet that difficulty and that sting with regret: I could have done more. But the hard truth is often a simple \"no\". No, you couldn't. Nobody could. This regret finds traction in the familiar constructs of \"if only I had\", \"perhaps if we had just\", \"but we also didn't\". These counterfactual building blocks stack up to obstruct the path to a deeper humility: You just don't have the power to turn someone into something they're not, in the short time that's available. That isn't to say that people can't learn, can't adapt, can't correct, even if they're off to a rough start. But that's all them doing that. Not you, as a manager. The best you can do is cheer them on, point them in the right direction, and give them the opportunities they need to prove that they have what it takes. You can't carry them there. So while it's always helpful to examine what went wrong, and be humble enough to recognize your own mistakes, you have to stop well short of the line where you step onto the agency of others. By the time someone shows up for a new job, even early in their careers, they have decades of life and experiences to their name. And usually years of skill development too. As well as an innate set of talents. That's a complicated system! One that's not only hard to reason about, but harder still to predict. Smart cookies at the biggest companies in the world have wrestled with this problem for ages. How do you predict whether someone will have the right mix to fit into this open situation? Nobody has yet nailed it. Nobody likely ever will. It'll probably always be a guess and a gamble. Once you accept that as a fundamental boundary on your capacity as a manager, it's going to set you free. Free from centering on the self-serving anguish over what The redeeming realization is that this is a great, big world. The human pieces that don't fit into your puzzle will complete someone else's. And in fact, if you refuse to let go of a piece that doesn't fit on your end, you're keeping someone else from making theirs. Besides, nobody wants to be the piece that doesn't fit.

Don't you dare spoil the bargain with this surveillance poison bullshit. the continued surge in interest for employee surveillance software, which risks turning a working arrangement that should be high on autonomy, flexibility, and creativity into one dominated by suspicion, anxiety, and dread. It needn't be this way.Maybe, just maybe, I can in retrospect forgive the knee-jerk impulse of managers breed in an office-only world their reach for surveillance-ware when the pandemic first broke out. You could at least claim then that it was all so new, that it was a highly stressful time, and that you made your mistakes out of pandemic-induced ignorance and fear. We still tried to arrest that development back then, in our small little way, banning surveillance-ware from integrating with Basecamp. Advocating, from experience, that surveillance wasn't the way. Speaking as experts who'd been running a remote company for over twenty years, written a whole book about it, and building healthy software products for working in this new way.But sadly the push for surveillance-ware, or bossware, or whatever you want to call the nasty proliferation of software that activates employee webcams to ensure butts are in seats, takes screenshots of their computer desktops at regular intervals, or scans everything entered on the keyboard with AI snitch filters, has continued unabated. Two years after those frantic first months of the pandemic, you can't claim ignorance or fear as excusable reasons to carry on like this. Now you have to accept that if you're a manager reaching for surveillance systems to supervise employees, this is just who you are. At least there's some hope that employees just won't stand for it. In a new survey by Axios, half of tech workers say they'd resign if subjected to these surveillance systems. Perhaps that tune is going to change now that tech layoffs have picked up dramatically in the last few months, but I hope not.When we wrote passionately about remote work in REMOTE: Office Not Required back in 2013, it was because it offered such a sweet two-sided deal. This was good for (most) employees, and it was good for employers. Higher productivity, better work products, more creative solutions accrued to the employer. Greater flexibility, freedom from the commute, and asynchronous collaboration accrued to the employee. Everybody wins!But you can spoil that shared victory in a heartbeat if you, as a manager, fail to transition from the antiquated line-of-sight style of supervision to one based on evaluating the quality of the work.

Bolt, for example, just announced a brutal 1/3 cut of all staff, after touching the sun with a $11 billion valuation just a few months ago. The secondary market for that stock has since been cut in half. Klarna and Robinhood both announced layoffs of about ten percent of staff.

Robinhood chopped ~300 positions, after its public stock got crushed from a peak of $85 to less than ten bucks today.

That our human search for meaning is sent seriously astray when we work a job that's pointless. And that the theater of productivity performed in pursuit of the pointless only offers a shallow distraction from the plot of existential anguish. Even more poignant is the observation that the resentment produced within those pointless job holders needs an outlet. Graeber points out that the outward manifestation of that tends to be toward those who work undeniably purposeful jobs. But the inward manifestation is just as corrosive. The self-loathing, the guilt, and endless quest for atonement. Ask yourself whether those sentiments might connect to some of our present-day corporate and cultural struggles... Either way, it's intolerable to be trapped in a bullshit job, and the victims are bound to seek refuge in any number of pathological activities that appear to offer a patina of meaning as relief. If that means inventing or exaggerating causes, enemies, and oppressions, so be it. That isn't to say this only afflicts those stuck in bullshit jobs, just that it's exacerbated by it. When the job is filled with intrinsic meaning and purpose, there's less left on the psychological budget to spend on exaggerations or outright fantasies. Which finally brings me to my addendum to Graeber's analysis. That these bullshit jobs that rot the hearts and minds of workers are far more likely to proliferate in big companies than in small ones. It's difficult to hold a bullshit job that contributes nothing of material value in a company of ten. In a company of ten thousand, it's often hard not to. Graber's definition of a bullshit job is broad enough to encompass work that has \"value\" in the sense that it might be, say, billable to clients, yet still be existentially worthless. And surely there are some small shops that trade in this variety of bullshit. So it's not entirely clear cut. But it's certainly slanted. The problem with big corporations is that they're beholden to a thousand seeds that cause bullshit jobs to blossom. Whether excessive risk management, communication or collaboration overhead, fiefdom building, pet projects kicked off on executive fancy, or the sheer lack of constraints in hiring. For small companies, these risks just largely aren't there because the distance between everyone is so low that you can clearly tell who's adding value and who's not. And the risks with saying \"thank you for your service but goodbye\" are far lower. I think this is at the crux of why startups and small companies in particular have such a unique attraction to many people. Even if it might mean lower pay than what the behemoths can offer. Even if we can't articulate exactly why we're drawn. Because the \"moral and spiritual damage\" that the risk of landing in a bullshit job can cause is perhaps the key risk of all employment decisions for white-collar workers today. Don't let the bullshit job eat your soul. We call them golden handcuffs for a reason. Find the key, then consider trying something smaller.", "date": "2022-05-24T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

That small but vocal gang of employees hellbent on canceling Chappelle last year over his comedy special. Now comes the counter offensive from the executive in the form of newly updated cultural guidelines at the company: As employees we support the principle that Netflix offers a diversity of stories, even if we find some titles counter to our own personal values. Depending on your role, you may need to work on titles you perceive to be harmful. If you’d find it hard to support our content breadth, Netflix may not be the best place for you. That's what happens after a moment of overreach. It leaves you exposed for the riposte. Netflix has now delivered just that, and it's not just a zinger, but a booby trap. By codifying the fact that Netflix expects employees to be able to work on a wide breadth of content, which invariably means some of it might offend individuals from time to time, they've drawn the boundaries of employment. This is the work! If you're not fit to perform your duties in service of that work, well, you can't be on the payroll. This didn't use to be controversial in the before times. Being, say, a proof reader at a publishing house did not mean you had to personally approve of every book that landed on your desk. That was the responsibility of the acquiring editor. And people broadly understood this. But in our brave new world, it's become common place to consider your job an integral part of your identity. And thus feeling like you're personally and morally liable for all decisions made and actions taken by said company. That's bound to result in a bad experience all around as soon as there are material disagreements (and there always are). It's not hard to see how we ended up here, though. After a few decades of tech companies insisting they're really families, craving unbridled passion from employees, and demanding a work-life balance that was all work and no life, the space and time needed for a personal, private identity has effectively been under corporate occupation. This is a predictable outcome. So Netflix taking an explicit stand against this is good. It's an admission in part that the strategy of boundless accommodation isn't working well for anyone.

I was over-connected with the world, acquaintances and friends from the past, and I wanted out. Zuckerberg has repeatedly doubled down on the toxic idea that we should only have one self, one persona. That we should be the same person in all social circles, lest we be “frauds”. I’m happy to be a fraud under that definition. I’m not the same person I was in high school. Not the same person I was at university. Not the same person I was with friends at age 15 as I was with a different group of friends at 21. I’m still not the same person with friends in programming as I am with friends in racing or with family or old mates from Denmark. What allowed me to change and prosper was the freedom to grow apart and lose touch with people. It’s hard to change yourself if you’re stuck in the same social orbit. There’s a gravitational force that pulls you into repeating the same circular pattern over and over again. Breaking out of that takes tremendous force. In real life, this force is mercifully thrust upon you at critical moments for self-discovery and evolution. You leave university, and you automatically lose touch with most of the people you knew there. It’s not an affront to anyone that this happens. It doesn’t take any effort. Everyone accepts that it’s a natural process. But Facebook changed that. It stunted this natural, gentle process of growing apart and losing touch. Now the default is to stay connected with everyone you’ve ever friended forever. And to break that connection, you have to actively sever it. Something most people don’t like doing, and don’t like having done to them, so it generally doesn’t happen. Knowing that everything you share will be seen by all these people from your past quietly. moderates what you actually share. Becoming someone else entails experimenting and failing with new styles and ideas. Not a lot of people are so keen to premiere such vulnerable stages of their evolution in front of an audience that expects them to be that same person they always were forever. I know I wasn’t. Neither was I interested in constantly living in the past with images and sharing from people whom a natural process would have seen me lose that touch with. It felt suffocating on both a conscious and unconscious level. Connected in the sense that an anchor is to a boat. A literal drag. So I pressed the red button and nuked all these synthetic connections from Facebook’s orbit in one go. It was liberating. -- -- *I wrote this piece four years ago, but was reminded of its conclusion after writing about the other peril of our over-connected world yesterday:**The quest to be special on a global scale**.

I don't think we want to see what the third, fourth, or fifth generation of such an adaptive evolution looks like. Then again, it isn't clear how we turn the ship around. Maybe it's [a scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRRNzK58ttw&t;=123s)at the beginning of The LEGO Movie where the main character Emmet is faced with the brutal assessment of his bland ordinariness by the people he works with. A few quotes: \"Look at Randy here, he likes sausage. That's something. Gail is perky, that's something... I mean, all [Emmet] does is say yes to everything everybody else is doing.. We all have something that makes us something, and Emmet is... nothing\". Ouch.This scene pins the deep fear in most people that the worst you can possibly be is ordinary. Plain. Bland. Not unique. If you don't have something special about you, your friends will barely even notice your existence. Thus making it utterly existential to ensure that you \"have something that makes you someone\". That used to be pretty easy. As the LEGO movie goes, all Randy needed to be someone is that \"he likes sausage\". That might be a caricature of a personality, but not by much. I remember growing up with that being pretty close to what made someone something. They really liked comic books! They were infatuated with frogs! They were really good at soccer. Or Mortal Kombat. Or came from a different country. Just a little something, just anything. But that was before the internet. When your comparison group was mainly a small group of friends, or maybe your class, or at most your school. It wasn't the whole damn world. It wasn't a single dominance hierarchy, as Jordan Peterson would put it. It was lots of isolated games of social belonging and uniqueness. None of which took that much effort to play to proficiency. Now, because of the internet, or more specifically, because of social media, you are so easily drawn into comparing yourself and your uniqueness with the whole damn world. And there are just too many people who like comic books. Or frogs. Or are way better at soccer or Mortal Kombat than you. And they're in your face all the time, because the best of everything, the most unique species of every subcategory, bubble to the top. Thus diluting whatever would have made you special in your little group in an instant. I think this global competition for uniqueness is partly to blame for the syndrome that Freddie deBoer describes in [\"Mental illness doesn’t make you special\"](https://unherd.com/2022/04/mental-illness-doesnt-make-you-special/). That one way to stand out as unique is to embrace and accentuate every quirk of personality, every sliver of peculiarity with a diagnosis that can form an integral part of one's personal branding. I don't just like frogs, I'm*obsessed*with them. Is there are diagnosis that fits this that I can apply as a sticker to my life, which will render me just that little bit extra unique?Clearly this is not all there is to it. And plenty of people are finding help or solace in describing or labeling aspects of their inner being. I found [Mark Dominus' critique of deBoer's piece](https://blog.plover.com/brain/add.html), and the comparison with Pippi Longstocking's freckles, compelling. But it didn't invalidate the insight deBoer is positing: That getting a diagnosis appears to have almost become a badge of honor and uniqueness in certain circles.There's a sense of irony in the fact that where the social ideal used to be that above all you wanted to be \"normal\" – but with a dash of quirkiness to just stand out a little! – it now often appears that in some of the social games being played it is about being as \"weird\" as possible. As afflicted as possible. As oppressed as possible. This connects to the new scoreboard of [intersectionality](https://newdiscourses.com/2022/01/true-history-intersectionality/). You think you have it bad? Ha. You're only suffering from two axis of oppression! I have three (or four or five!)! And together these strains, together with that diagnosis, is what make me extra special and worthy of attention.We're a [mimetic species](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FZ8QTP4/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title).

But I clearly remember the time before I was checking the latest developments in the world three times per day (or four or five!). I remember momentous events like 9/11 or the swine flu pandemic from an era before being hooked into an IV feed of BREAKING NEWS. World events that registered, but didn’t wash over my mind with all the minute details and their angles. And then I remember the killing of Bin Laden, Fukushima, and Charlie Sheen’s WINNING stories from 2011 with a very different fidelity of commentary, reporting, and engagement. So that pretty much pins this change in news consumption to about 2010. Meaning it’s now been over a decade. Which is a good time to reflect over whether what you’ve been doing is worth continuing. To be fair, this moment of contemplation didn’t actually come as a result of any anniversary. First, a seed had been planted at the beginning of this year when the pandemic stopped setting the daily agenda in Denmark. On the one hand, it was a relief, but on the other also an abrupt end to an exceptionally decadent news binge that had lasted the past two years. It meant waking up from that binge with an intellectual headache, pondering what was it all for? What difference did it make to know all the daily infection numbers? Reading every damn long-form piece on what the pandemic was doing, and what we were all doing because of it? What was the residual knowledge, insight, or wisdom gathered by all that reading? Following the news often leaves you with this sense that you’re doing something worthwhile. You’re informed! But are you really? Is following the cherry-picked events of the day with the intensity and urgency as though these events were yours helping anyone? Yourself? Others? These were the questions I was struggling to come up with compelling answers to. And as the transition from breathless covid coverage bled seamlessly into breathless war coverage, I took the opportunity to insert my own break. A break from breaking news. A break from obsessively following the news. Any news. For the first time in over a decade. What a relief. It's not that I've holed myself up in a cave somewhere, cut off from the world around me, since then. I've just gone back to the way I was living prior to 2010.

It's funny, though. The muscle memory is still there. I still pull the phone out far more often than it has any value. My brain still craves the slot machine.

So you get the slot machine effect, but again, it's limited. 10 photos, then you're done.

Or, rather, whatever shits it gives are about listening *more* to what that guy has to say, and the guests he brings on his show.

Look at all those bikes! What a clean city! See all those pedestrians dutifully waiting at the crossover for the light to turn green without a car in sight! All these observations stick out, but none trigger the culture shock like seeing kids everywhere. Little kids, big kids, kids on bikes, kids on the metro, kids walking with their parents, kids walking alone. Kids, kids, kids! Kids are visible in the city landscape of Copenhagen like no major American city I've ever lived or visited. Not because there are actually more children in Denmark than the US. On average, Americans have slightly more children than Danes. But you'd swear that wasn't so by comparing the metropolitan areas. The importance of this difference is of course not just that the cityscape feels more alive, more welcoming, and more human in Copenhagen (although it also does that). It's the fact that this prevalence of kids everywhere means they have real autonomy and independence. Freedoms that have been rapidly disappearing for many American kids. Jonathan Haidt In the US, virtually all interactions outside of school for our elementary school kids were not just scheduled, but supervised and chaperone by adults. Play dates usually involved parents from all participating kids. And I can't imagine many parents in New York City who would contemplate letting their eight year-old take the subway by themselves to and from school. Yet that's exactly what we've been able to let our oldest do on the Copenhagen metro. It's also not at all uncommon to see second graders biking in heavy traffic (protected by bike lanes) to school. We've let our oldest run errands around our inner-city neighborhood since he was eight as well. Go to the kiosk around the corner for a treat. Pick up some groceries from the market. Go with his friend to the park alone after school. Oh, and of course spend copious amounts of unscheduled time with friends without that requiring an organized play date, parents hanging out, or any of the other social and protective machinery we were accustomed to in the US. Now all this feels a little silly to write. Because that's exactly how I grew up in the 80s in Copenhagen as well. It really hasn't changed much. I explored the city by bus or bike or rollerblades on my own from second or third grade as well. Walked to and from school alone early too. Never involved my parents in who I was seeing after school or where we were going. And I get the impression that this was indeed also largely how things were in America in the 80s. My wife had similar freedoms, similar autonomy and independence, in small town USA back then. But that's not the America that I've witnessed while living there. Not for our kids, not for the kids of anyone we know. And that just seems tragic. There's such a glow of accomplishment on the face of our boys when they push another boundary of independence. I thought about all of this for two reasons. First because our six-year old was keen for him and his three years older brother to take the metro alone to school together this morning. So they did. No big deal. And second because that made me recall recently The Japanese show was treated mostly as this exotic dispatch from another world. A curiosity utterly disconnected from the reality of Americans. Not that it's hard to see why. You'd immediately be pursued by social services or the police in the US if you let a three-year old run around the city by themselves. But because it was so alien, I think most Americans watching aren't likely to use the example to truly contemplate how they might change their own parenting style or patterns. The kids from Japan might as well have been from Mars. That's a missed opportunity.

Basecamp as a company also does not weigh in on politics publicly, outside of topics directly related to our business. You should be at peace with both of these stances. That's the signal that you needn't apply to an opening at Basecamp, if our etiquette on societal politics at work isn't compatible with what you want out of a job. Being upfront about this has worked wonders to ensure we attract folks who can see themselves at a company like Basecamp, and that those who don't apply elsewhere. Ultimately, we've found definitive proof of the new calm in the Miami sun.

And for once, all the hype was completely justified. The M1 chip is the kind of big leap forward that even ordinary people notice. My wife instantly noticed just how much better, smoother everything ran when she swapped her Intel MacBook for an M1 MacBook. Not to mention the battery life. But the reason we call it a big leap is because it stands out from all the ordinary leaps. Those regular yearly incremental improvements that most people just don't feel. It's remarkable because it's rare. I think I probably forgot that a bit when I immediately jumped from an M1 MacBook Air to a M1 MacBook Pro the second the latter was announced. And I was just about to forget it once again when the new Mac Studio with the M1 Ultra was announced. I had that Ultra machine all specced out in my cart when it suddenly struck me that I actually couldn't recall any material difference hopping from the original M1 to the M1 Max machine. What if instead of splurging once again for more imperceptible power, I swapped back to that 2020 machine, just to feel the difference? So I did that, and I couldn't. Feel the difference that is. The 2020 M1 MacBook runs everything that I do more or less exactly as well as the three times more expensive specced-out MacBook Pro. Well, sure, I can measure an all-core full suite test run of our apps and find an advantage. But it's not consequential, and that's not a workflow I do all the time. Not even editing 50 megapixel photos in Lightroom seemed noticeably different. That's not to say that the Max or the Ultra M1s aren't a big deal to some people. I'm sure if you're editing multiple streams of 8K video on the daily, then it's a big deal to you. And surely there are other workflows that benefit from just throwing more cores and codec units at the problem. Web development is not it, though. So now I'm back on that 2020 M1 MacBook Air again. And do you know what, I actually appreciate some of those vintage Ive sensibilities again: Slimness and lightness as qualities in themselves. Once a machine is Fast Enough and the battery lasts Long Enough, making it lighter and slimmer really does count for more. I don't even mind the machine just having 2 USB Cs. Maybe Ive was right all along – minus that awful keyboard! – he just didn't have the chips to fulfill his vision.

I'll be participating in the #43 Inter Europe Competition LMP2 car running under the Polish flag alongside team mates Fabio Scherer from Switzerland and Pietro Fittipaldi from Brazil. This is what our car will look like: I actually thought I was going to hang up the helmet after the pandemic. When we finished 2nd at the 12 Hours of Sebring in 2020, it felt like the magic was gone. That the portal to the pure state of flow had been closed. That shutting the cockpit door no longer kept the world out and the focus in. And then why was I still here? But sometimes all you need is a break. I'd been racing at a high level without a pause for about a decade. Most of those years traveling around the globe for the World Endurance Championship, easily spending a quarter of the year on the go. It may sound glamorous, but the reality is that you rarely get to see much outside the track when traveling for racing. Except for a few particularly wonderful times in Japan with the family, it was mostly just airport-hotel-track-hotel-airport trips. So the racing itself really has to provide the draw. After Sebring, there was no draw. Just weary. I had my fill, or so I thought. I skipped Le Mans that year too, after having gone for eight years straight since 2012. It felt fine. The race even seemed alien without the hundreds of thousands of fans usually there. It almost felt like a virtual event. I didn't give racing much thought after that. Until Le Mans 2021. Ugh. Suddenly the draw was back. It was still an odd atmosphere, but that somehow didn't seem to matter as much. I really missed being on that grid. Missed Tertre Rouge, Indianapolis, Mulsanne, Porsche Curves, and all the famous corners on this epic track. The truth is that racing for me was always about Le Mans. It's by far and away my favorite track in the world. After close to a thousand laps over the years, it still pulls like nothing else. It's the only track in the world that I can spend hours driving on a simulator all by myself without getting bored. It's simply sublime. So when an old team mate reached out at the end of last year with a potential program for 2022, it lit the spark, and the hunt for the best seat with the most promising line-up in a competitive car was on. And that #43 combo delivered all that. In addition to Le Mans, we'll be competing in the European Le Mans Series. Going to classic tracks like Monza and Spa. It's not going to be an easy time. In the series, we'll have 16 competitors in our class, and at Le Mans, a record-breaking 26. Though going there for the ninth time, after the class win with Aston Martin in 2014, finishing on the podium in four out of eight appearances, there's nothing to prove. Which of course means we'll be throwing everything at it to win! A month ago, I drove a proper race car in pre-season testing for the first time in almost a year and a half. After the first ten laps, I thought, shit, I've made a mistake. I've totally lost the feel. But then snap, the brain acclimates, and after four hours of pounding around the Portimão track in the Portuguese sun, the world had once again been completely isolated to outside the cockpit, the flow state was constant, and the smile couldn't be wider.", "date": "2022-03-11T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

But not only do the majority of people in the US never tweet, they're also increasingly disconnecting from party affiliations. Here's[a quippy summary](https://www.axios.com/political-polarization-twitter-cable-news-ac9699c6-260d-4141-b511-5c7193566ea1.html)from Axios:Most people you meet in everyday life — at work, in the neighborhood — are decent and normal. Even nice. But hit Twitter or watch the news, and you'd think we were all nuts and nasty. 75% of people in the U.S. never tweet, Independents would be the biggest party. These facts are solidly confirmed by media consumption. Joe Rogan's independent podcast is vastly more popular than even the most popular weeknight primetime show on the biggest cable news channel (Fox News). Even [Russell Brand](https://world.hey.com/dhh/russell-brand-is-grand-ce7bbe99)brings more viewers to his daily commentary show on YouTube than MSNBC can muster for their weeknight primetime shows. This reality, as Axios puts it, of \"decent and normal\" people not expressing their preferences on the big topics online means they appear silent. Until suddenly they reveal their big stick as a belated reply, and the commentariat is surprised by the force. Look at the debate over critical race theory, anti-racism, wokeness, or whatever you want to call what's going on in some American schools. The push to redistribute admissions away from Asian Americans at elite public schools to other minorities that are deemed under represented. Or the push to rename schools in San Francisco with the names of historical figures that are being accused of racism, like Abraham Lincoln. If you only took the pulse of these debates, especially in the beginning of either phenomenon, on Twitter, you'd be convinced that both causes were very popular. That forum was full of proponents of these policies, and nearly void of opponents. But then came the reply. First in Virginia, where the silent majority of parents opposed to the school policy changes managed to swing a solidly Democrat state red in the governor's race by [electing Republican Glenn Youngkin](https://news.yahoo.com/republican-glenn-youngkin-wins-virginia-governors-race-044547770.html). Then in San Francisco, where an unheard of [70%+ of voters recalled](https://abcnews.go.com/US/san-francisco-recalls-school-board-members-amid-debate/story?id=82920559)three school board members who were seen as being focused on these divisive policy changes instead of, as major London Breed noted, \"[being focused] on the essentials of delivering a well-run school system above all else\". Or how about the clash over whether Chapelle should be allowed to perform his comedy in specials on Netflix. For a while, Twitter was ablaze with indignation, calls for cancelations, and there were even a few small protests at the company headquarter. What was the silent majority's reply to this outrage? To keep watching Chapelle and to keep subscribing to Netflix. Same story at Spotify, which dominated several news cycles over Joe Rogan's supposed transgressions around pandemic discourse. That even got a few old rockers to pull their music. And the reply? Even more people listening to Rogan, no real blip in the subscription business for Spotify. None of this is a verdict on the virtue or not of these activist campaigns against Chapelle or Rogan, Netflix or Spotify. You can make up your own mind about that. What's interesting is to look at the silent majority's reply. In politics they vote with their ballot, in commerce they vote with their wallet. Now it's fair to be suspect of those voting wallets. Especially in realms dominated by monopoly power. Even if someone disliked something Apple or Google did, it's very difficult to switch ecosystems (and there are only two choices anyway!). But streaming music and streaming video? Two of the most competitive arenas on the internet! Scarcely any friction in hopping from Spotify to Apple Music or from Netflix to Amazon Video or HBO or whatever. Same story within the world of developers. GitHub took tremendous heat for a while for keeping their contract with the American immigration authorities during the Trump years. How many developers moved their projects in protest to GitLab or some other source repository? I can't even recall one. Today you really have to look to find folks expressing this old grudge, even though I believe the contract is still ongoing, but I guess the agency is now under different political management so 🤷♂️. You could run the same argument with Coinbase or Shopify and their respective controversies. The loud minority loom impossibly large for a brief moment in history, and then change or not comes on the basis of the silent majority's reply.

It's been a revelation. Part of this came as a result of The first revelation was that no matter how introvert you are, spending time face-to-face with others after prolonged periods of isolation is nourishing in a profound and human way (even if it's also exhausting). And our family weren't even The second revelation was just how normal and calm all these interactions and conversations were. No matter the topic. In stark contrast to what appears to be a continued deterioration of social media's ability to do the same. And it's not just because Danes all think the same about everything (they don't; except maybe liking smørrebrød!), but because of the delightful ballet of social graces that would be performed whenever the conversation would land on a topic with a clear difference of opinion. I don't think this ballet would have registered, had it not been for these long pandemic years. But like if you cut out sugar for a month, then take your first bite of a frosted cake, the experience is vivid and detailed. You notice tastes and textures that wouldn't have stood out without the deprivation. This conversational ballet incorporates all the graceful ways two people sitting in front of each other can steer a discussion through facial expressions, posture, and pauses. You start going down a path that suddenly narrows as a raised brow reveals a sensitivity, and you either step more softly, or find your way back to another topic. It all happens so effortlessly, so imperceptibly, that most people probably don't even notice. The irony of now essentially singing a hymn to the objections against remote work is not lost on me. I can easily see how years of severe social isolation, especially for people living alone, could strain or even break this ability to relate to others in a fundamentally human way. If everyone in your life has been reduced to an avatar for too long, the world does become very flat and two dimensional. Maybe that's part of the answer for why social media in particular has been growing even harder, angrier, bitter, and resentful during the pandemic. It wasn't just, as I initially thought, that the world was uniquely difficult. It was also that, but our inability to integrate those challenges with others, in-person might well have been the bigger problem. So maybe this is how we break and escape this viscous feedback loop. Where loneliness leads to alienation leads to despair leads to forming desparate virtual bonds leads to tribalism, hate, and a miserable quest for meaning. There's a reason subjecting prisoners to total isolation for even a few days is considered torture. Even the most introverted among us need human connection. We're hardwired for it. And we'll find it in whatever dysfunctional forms we can, because anything is better than nothing. I think we may well look back upon these social dark ages of the pandemic as a grand social experiment of microdosing a huge swath of the population with this unique form of isolation torture. No wonder so many self-medicated with social media, overdosed on its partisanship, and now have a really difficult time letting go. But the antidote is there. It's waiting. It's other people, in flesh and blood, without a mask, without an agenda. May we spread it with the same vigor we vested in the vaccines.", "date": "2022-03-08T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

So if you only weigh an argument's worth on whether it served to convert someone to your perspective this instant, you'll usually be disappointed. \"Right now, right here\" is a bad timeframe to measure the success of your arguments on. There's a long tail of conversion. Because even when the best arguments fail to breach the mental walls, they often leave cracks. Cracks which time, new observations, and deeper consideration can open. Until the walls finally crumble, and a perspective is let in. This might happen five minutes after the debate is over, two weeks later, or even a couple of years from now. Some arguments cause cracks that can take a decade or more to tumble the hardened walls of our mind. Often it's not even clear which exact argument and crack lead to the final change, because a dozen of them developed concurrently. I've been writing and arguing on the internet for well over two decades. I've seen this pattern time and again.

Cracks which time, new observations, and deeper consideration can open. Until the walls finally crumble, and a perspective is let in. This might happen five minutes after the debate is over, two weeks later, or even a couple of years from now. Some arguments cause cracks that can take a decade or more to tumble the hardened walls of our mind. Often it's not even clear which exact argument and crack lead to the final change, because a dozen of them developed concurrently.

I first encountered it in Jonathan Haidt's book The Righteous Mind. It goes like this: The mind is divided, like a rider on an elephant, and the rider’s job is to serve the elephant. The rider is our conscious reasoning—the stream of words and images of which we are fully aware. The elephant is the other 99 percent of mental processes—the ones that occur outside of awareness but that actually govern most of our behavior. It's the same underlying premise to Julia Galaef's book The Scout Mindset. We launder our arguments and reasoning through the tribal wash. Which is made easier by the fact that many valiant principles are in opposition to each other, and that you can often conveniently lean on the ones that serve the moment and your tribe. Without even consciously being aware of this process of motivated reasoning. But I think we're unconsciously very aware, actually. Which is why it often appears that the most infuriating, polarizing figures are those who do not succumb to this tribal-first reasoning. They mere being insert a splinter in the minds of those embracing the tribal stance – i.e. most people – that living closer to universal principles is possible. In my book, one of the best examples of this is Glenn Greenwald. He used to be a hero of the left when he was haunting the Bush administration during the early Iraq War years. But slowly, then all at once, fell out of favor when he applied the same principles of inquiry to first the Obama administration, then later to Hillary and the loss to Trump. The same principles that drew applause when they were directed against the right suddenly invoked the most indignant contempt when they were applied to the left. And it cut both ways! Those on the right who would have had no bones calling him a traitor during the Bush years now happily embraced his inquiries during the Obama years and today. It didn't even matter to many that he broke several of the biggest stories of our time. Like the Snowden revelations and the Brazilian corruption scandals. The fact that he applied universal principles caused such severe cognitive-dissonance hangovers amongst former supporters that he now seemed worse than even the other side. He became a traitor to the team. But what perhaps impresses me the most about Greenwald's continued quest for universal principles is his seemingly unlimited faith in the possibility of a world that could be governed by such high-minded ideals. Despite the recurring evidence to the contrary. Despite the torrent of insults and jeers that meets his repeated attempts at applying such principles. The world needs unreasonably reasonable people. To give us hope that principles can serve a higher cause, not just be used to score partisan points. Even if I'm probably more convinced than ever that Haidt's metaphor simply is the base nature of humanity. That we're hard-wired to be of weak principles and strong tribal allegiance. It's unlikely that we'll suddenly all become perfect scouts through intellectual role modeling, but minting more scouts with stronger allegiance to universal principles is still a noble cause.", "date": "2022-03-04T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

But that's chatter for a Rails 7.next or Rails 8 discussion. Point is that all of this was conceived, coordinated, and built in 2021. What. A. Year. So imagine my surprise when I got this email from the folks at Ruby Central, who've been organizing RailsConf, the conference I helped kick off in 2006: the third major version of Ruby, and left it with the accomplishment of the seventh major version of Rails. Together, these releases sparked a renewed enthusiasm for building modern web applications with Ruby on Rails, unlike anything I can recall since the late oughts. The moment was finally right, and we were right for the moment.I spent most of my time last year advancing the new vision of Rails on the frontend with a slew of projects. The biggest lift was getting the dream of a Node-free default Rails approach validated, solidified, and production ready. I worked to make that happen by creating importmap-rails, and by taking HEY to this new frontier as a confirmation that we'd crossed the chasm from vision to reality. Collaborating with Guy Bedford on his crucial enabling work with es-module-shims.As a result, we really did manage to dramatically compress the complexity of both getting started with Rails, and making those high-fidelity apps that rely on modern JavaScript.This happened concurrently with the effort to have Rails adopt Hotwire as a replacement for the old Turbolinks and Rails UJS combo. Giving every new Rails app the power of Turbo 7 and Stimulus 3 as standard, without having to deal with a node_modules directory of thousands of dependencies or webpack configurations up the wazoo. I built turbo-rails and stimulus-rails to make the integration seamless with the JavaScript frameworks we'd spent years developing at Basecamp.Between getting rid of Node, forging a part with import maps, and committing to Hotwire, the default frontend story for Rails became complete and compelling unlike anything we've ever had before. No more excuses or apologies for the rabbit hole that Webpacker could often be or the limitations of Sprockets. While this new, daring default path for Rails 7 turned out to be a bull's eye hit, I'm almost as proud of the improvements to the alternate route as well. There are many reasons why someone would want to embrace Node, transpiling, bundling, and the rest of the complexities inherent with the traditional JavaScript path. Whether that be because the entire UI is written in React, Vue, or whatever, this approach isn't going anywhere, and Rails should have first-class affordances. Now it does!With jsbundling-rails, I created a bridge between a fully native JavaScript experience and our Rails asset pipeline. Free from being hardcoded to webpack and a particular configuration of that, Rails 7 has made it trivial to use all of the major bundlers, including esbuild and rollup.js. But perhaps in particular esbuild, which has emerged as the most promising solution with incredibly fast compilation and simpler configuration.I then followed the crumbs of compression from jsbundling-rails and created cssbundling-rails. Which leaned on the same insights and simplifications to make integrating with Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, PostCSS, and Dart Sass a turn-key operation. Embracing the fact that many of these modern CSS frameworks require a full JavaScript setup for detailed configuration and integration.So whether you want to go Node-less, full Node, or no front-end inside the Rails app at all, we now have stellar answers for every choice. That's a big tent! Which means that more people in more situations can enjoy and collaborate on the parts of Rails that we all love and share. Active Records and Action Controllers pair perfectly with all the options.As if that wasn't enough, I was really happy to finally crack the nut of a proper Redis abstraction in Rails together with Kasper Timm Hansen. We've been using Redis for a very long time at Basecamp, but always at a surprisingly low level. Then suddenly, emerging from the work we'd done in HEY and Basecamp, the right abstraction appeared, and the result became Kredis. Now an official second-party framework to Rails, and suggested in the default Gemfile.To properly commemorate all this delightful progress, as well as capture the energy and enthusiasm of the reception, I worked with our new designer Sean Mitchell at Basecamp to create the first new Rails site in six years. With a fresh identity, bootscreen, and introduction video. It looks great, and perfectly capped off this monumental effort to set Rails on a new course.And these are just the projects and improvements that hit primetime in 2021! I also spent the year charting a direction for compounding compressions to come in Rails 8, and beyond. Our trusted asset pipeline, Sprockets, has been long in the tooth, underdeveloped, and overcomplicated for our needs today for too long. To remedy that for tomorrow, I created Propshaft as a clean-sheet implementation of an asset pipeline built for the challenges we face in 2021+. And then worked with Breno Gazzola to make that production ready faster than I had imagined (we're already running on Propshaft in production with HEY!).This led directly to the development of tailwindcss-rails and dartsass-rails. Two wrap-the-standalone-executables gems that make using the full power of Tailwind CSS and Dart Sass possible with a Node-less application, and specifically designed for Propshaft (since it doesn't have a built-in Sass compiler, unlike Sprockets). Mike Dalessio was instrumental in setting up the gem-by-platform encapsulation, and I can't thank Adam Wathan and the Tailwind team enough for heeding my pleas to wrap Tailwind CSS 3 as standalone version we wouldn't need Node for.While these developments are already suitable for those who enjoy life at the frontier, I'm even more excited to get them to a place where they can become stronger, perhaps default, recommendations going forward. But that's chatter for a Rails 7.next or Rails 8 discussion. Point is that all of this was conceived, coordinated, and built in 2021. What. A. Year. So imagine my surprise when I got this email from the folks at Ruby Central, who've been organizing RailsConf, the conference I helped kick off in 2006: Hi David, Hope you’ve been well. With you having been mostly offline the last year, the program committee has decided it would be valuable for the community to start sharing the opening keynote stage with other contributors. We have a few in mind but if you have any suggestions of people who have been impactful this year, please share them. If you have any questions, please let me know. - Evan It's a real shame that this is the world we find ourselves in now. One so sharply divided by politics and ideology that we can't even share the love of Ruby on Rails together at a conference without a need to settle scores. But I guess it shouldn't come as a surprise. The way the debacle around the announced web3 track at RailsConf was handled was just one illustration that this is where we are now. That an interest in learning and exploring new technologies first need to pass a partisan filter, and if it doesn't, there's hell to pay and groveling apologies to be made. No matter whether that's a space that has activity from some of the largest Rails apps and employers. What does \"you having been mostly offline the last year\" even mean? Is there a pious tweet minimum? What does that have to be with being \"impactful\" with the work? I know, trying to deduce an inner logic of an obvious pretext is a fool's errand. But it also casts an unfortunate shadow of uncertainty over the whole event. Should companies that support RailsConf by sending employees, speakers, or sponsorship money expect retaliation or exclusion if they end up transgressing against whatever shrinking ideological ring surround the organizers or program committee? Would GitHub have faced such retaliation if the ICE controversy had broken today? Would Shopify employees have been denied stage time if the Breitbart issue had happened now? Is a company like Coinbase or Block or even Shopify welcome at all given their involvement with crypto and web3? Either way, while it's a shame that the organizers and program committee for RailsConf have chosen this path, it's not going to dim my enthusiasm for Ruby on Rails and our bright future in the slightest. There's so much exciting energy right now, and I have more motivation for pushing our framework forward than I've had in many years. I'll be thrilled to share my yearly keynote with everyone either at another in-person conference this year or online. With close to twenty years of involvement in this community, I'm confident we'll be able to eventually route around the fractious politicization that's been leaking into our proceedings. I don't believe that this is what most programmers or most companies ultimately want. But it's a perilous time to reveal preferences, so I fully understand why many choose to duck instead. For me, this work has always been a labor of love. It's so gratifying to see new programmers realize what they can build, and existing Ruby on Rails companies reach the skies. Nothing can detract from that. Cheers to another two decades and beyond of open source collaboration, beautiful code, and happy programmers! ✌️❤️", "date": "2022-03-03T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Jason made the excellent point that these types of dangerous conversations that are increasingly leading to dire consequences for those who dare touch them in public aren't actually disappearing. They're moving. That the repressive, partisan nature of Twitter in particular isn't only leading to large amounts of self-censorship (though that too), but also fueling a new interest in private chats. That's a connection I hadn't really paid much attention to until Jason brought it up. But now I see it everywhere. I'm in a range of private chats now where these types of open debates about dangerous topics are flowing freely. I dive in with those who reply to this newsletter in such conversations all the time as well. I see it with friends and my wife too. Refuge is being sought in privacy. Might this be the way out of the cesspool that is modern social media? Reasonable people retaining their voice, but using it in more private spaces? One could hope.

Might the next wave be abandoning social media altogether, and finding meaning in smaller groups again?

It can't be long before the fingers start pointing in his direction. But I can see how he's been able to slide past the professionally outraged class of media watchers so far. I mean, look at him! He's the anti-Rogan persona from afar. Dressed like hippie, pontificating like a poet. Stepped in an ethos of peace, love, and harmony. You can't make a right-wing, meat-head, or dude bro accusation stick on that long-haired, occasionally-bearded artist. In this age of identitarianism, this presentation is not to be dismissed. I think it's key why Brand has been able to escape the same unity of condemnation that has met Rogan. For the same reason that John McWhorter and Glenn Loury are able to tackle the questions of wokeness with a greater effectiveness than would many others of a different skin color. Just watch Brand break down the problems with using the financial system as a form of political punishment against people who have not been convicted of any crimes. Not only is it funny, but it's poetic too! Brand has a way of articulating his position that makes it feel like you're listening to a mashup of poetry slam and the evening news. It's a novel and beautiful art form. Or take this one, where he tackles the issue of homes being bought by corporate entities, and ties it with the 'you'll own nothing and be happy' paradigm. Or this one, where he examines the pandemic rage, and advocates for a loving, brotherly acceptance and understanding. He really does not fit in neatly with the false dichotomy of the culture wars. He's about as laughably far away from right wing as that signature crow of his could carry him. You can't squint and see his silhouette in a MAGA hat. Which really is deeply problematic to any attempt of putting him in one of the two boxes. Which then again is key to his power to reach those who would have dismissed his message from any other.

You can't easily do that if your feature has been chopped into itty bitty pieces as independent pull requests under pressure never to let them run longer than a week. So at Basecamp, we let pull requests run as long as they need to encompass a complete feature or fix. That's everything from a few weeks up to as much as six (since we follow This approach isn't entirely without trade-offs. The longer your pull request is running off the main branch, the greater the chance that you'll have merge conflicts. But you can mitigate much of this by ensuring you keep your pull request up to date with main by frequently merging main into the pull request. I can appreciate how very large organizations with high traffic on the same bits of code might hit a point where that still just doesn't cut it, but is that really you? It's never been us. And we've frequently had a handful of teams working on the same product, working in close proximity. And yes, we've occasionally hit merge conflicts, but I can't remember the last time those were seriously impeding the work. Still, there's a cost, and the larger you are, the bigger it may become. But that's what frustrates me a little about the debate over how long to let your pull requests run. It focuses mostly on the cost, not on the value. And the value is tremendous to any organization that seeks to keep high design standards and a cohesive architecture. One way to think about the degradation of code reviews that results from doing them across many, separate, disjointed pull requests, without seeing the big picture until the end, is through the negative externalities that this process produces. High design standards and a cohesive architecture bank the rivers of clear code. When you pour those partially-there, I-havent-seen-the-end pull requests in, you easily end up polluting those pristine waters. It isn't clear right away what that might do, it's just a drop in the river after all, but if you keep it up, eventually the rivers no longer run clear. I'm thinking of code that didn't embrace a key insight to simplify the whole thing when viewed as a whole from 30,000 feet. Code that doesn't leave the campsite in a better condition than it found it, because doing the cleanup is something for another pull request, on another day (by no one ever). Code that's been shipped now feeling too much of a hassle to change. We often think of the code review as something done by others, but it's frequently just as powerful a method for a programmer to do to themselves. When working on a substantial piece of work, I'm frequently hopping back and forth between TextMate and the complete GitHub diff for all the commits. It's in this dance you see the shape of the code, pick up on bad smells, and ultimately decide whether you're happy with the whole. So please don't chop up your pull requests until the cost of doing so definitively outpaces the value.

Others that 'hateful rhetoric' or 'unacceptable views' was violence in speech. Others still that incessant honking or blocked streets constituted violence against the peace and habitability of their city. There may or may not be merit to any or all of these grievances. Reasonable people can disagree about what constitutes 'hateful rhetoric', for example. And I'm sure anyone would grow impatient with incessant honking if they lived near by. But that does not connect any of these objections in any logical line with the term 'violence'. To do that, you need to willfully conflate and redefine its meaning to fit a political agenda. See, once you've claimed something to be violent, you've justified the maximum severity of a response. Actions that would never seem reasonable against 'peaceful protestors' are now suddenly warranted. (Which is what gives peaceful protests such tremendous power – they deny legitimacy to severe crackdowns.) That's how the truckers stymied the powers in Ottawa for so long. These weren't the protests of burning buildings, looted stores, or coordinated attacks on police. I remember one report from a major outlet including such offenses as drunkenly disorder and public urination amongst the crimes committed. You know they're really scrapping the barrel when violations such as these end up in news reports. So this is why the designation of 'peaceful' had to be contested. Disputing that assessment was and always is the key to unlocking a draconian response. Every despot under the sun knows to legitimize their disproportionate intervention by claiming to protect the security of the people. And if no credible threat to such security exist, they manufacture it, even if just rhetorically. A healthy democracy on the other hand would have engaged. Met with the protestors rather than demonized them. Offered concessions were reasonable to show reasonableness. Included their voice in the conversation. That could have disarmed the brunt of the energy or at least diminished it. Instead the response appears designed to radicalize further. To alienate. To ostracize. And to persecute. It's a response of vindictiveness, and guilt by association. It's also the potential start of the kind of cycle that leads to nowhere good. The logic of 'beatings will continue until morale improves'. And it's all rooted in this word: Violence. It's definition. It's now tortured definition. It's all encompassing reach.

Since the early 2010s, some of my most ferocious Twitter battles have been against There's just so much to oppose: Beyond all these very real problems and challenges, my bigger beef was actually fueled by a lack of imagination. I could see the fundamental promise of a digital currency free of banks if you were living in a failing state like Venezuela or an overtly authoritarian one like China or Iran, but how was this relevant to the vast number of Bitcoin boosters living in stable Western democracies governed by the rule of law? Beyond the patina of philosophical respectability it could apply to yet another get-rich-quick scheme? Now what's that saying again. Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't after you. It's starting to smell like that. Just because Bitcoin's most virtuous argument was presented – in if not bad-faith then in fig-leaf-faith – by get-rich-quick boosters, doesn't mean it isn't true! Enter First the Ottawa police department got GoFundMe to confiscate donations with the intention of redirecting them to other causes, then after an outcry, they backed down to merely blocking the money for 7-10 days before refunding. That seemed like a draconian escalation completely at odds with the tens of millions of dollars raised for social justice causes during the protest summer of 2020. But at the time, I thought it was something another fund-raising platform – one less likely to collaborate with the Canadian authorities – could route around. And GiveSendGo indeed started doing just that. Turns out the concern over the donations was quickly rendered insignificant, as just a few days later, the Canadian prime minister So Canadians who donated to the truckers should now sleep with one eye open for the next several months, lest they have their bank accounts frozen, and indictments filed on the basis of laws enacted to prevent financing of terrorism?

Then it turns out that the worries of an authoritarian overreach would be fulfilled by Trudeau to the North instead? Who's writing this script? M. Night Shyamalan? Meanwhile, plenty of American commentators are But in a weird way, I'm glad we all got this warning from Trudeau in Canada and not Trump in America. It would have been far too easy for Europeans in particular to dismiss authoritarian assertions of martial law from Trump as being irrelevant to the European experience. Just like I had for so long deemed the practical desire of people in Venezuela or Iran or China for crypto irrelevant to the entire Western experience. Is It reminds me of the Snowden revelations. Prior to him bringing proof, the idea that America was processing all the emails in the world, recording any phone call anywhere at will, and monitoring all internet traffic just seemed so hyperbolic. I remember discussing this with a friend in the 2000s when the rumors of I'm sitting with that same feeling here. Even just a few months ago, I would not have found it credible if you said a three-week peaceful protest in Canada could have lead to martial law, frozen bank accounts, and terrorist-financing laws being used to hunt protest donors. Unbelievable then, undeniable now. I don't think we have any idea what kind of radicalizing seeds have been planted by Trudeau with these actions. This is one of those world events that you can imagine a documentary of the future opening with: \"It all started when...\".

And it's far more ephemeral than the goodwill of consumers. The relationship is more intertwined. We're not just engaging in transactions, we're lifting each other up. Good developers breed strong platforms, and strong platforms attract good developers. When it works, it's symbiotic. There's nothing symbiotic about Apple's current relationship with its developers. Every time Apple mobilizes its law machine to squash a developer in court, foil democratic accountability in the legislatures, or give regulators the middle finger, Apple wounds the relationship with developers. They can win every battle in court, lobby around every hearing in the house, and pay all the trifling regulatory fines, and still ultimately end up losing something far more long-term important than a monopoly tax rake. This state of affairs is depressingly ironic to those of us who embraced Apple in the early 2000s to get away from Microsoft. Back then, Microsoft was the big bully of tech, and, for a while, just as unavoidable as Apple is today. You were either on Windows or you were nowhere. Just like with the iPhone now. I remember having a deep dislike of every PC I owned through the 90s. Partly because I had come from the Amiga, which just felt like such a nicer, more cohesive platform. And the only reason I had to go with the PC was because Commodore fumbled their lead and languished. The Amiga spirit was inspiring, but the PC was alive. You could either worship a shrine or move with the times. I choose, begrudgingly, the latter. This animosity really reached its zenith with the infamous directive from Microsoft to \"cut off the air supply\" to Netscape. The internet was to become our way out of Microsoft's dominant tyranny, and of course Gates & Gang weren't going to let that happen without a fight. So they fought in the same petulant way that we'd later recognize from Cook. But the DOJ wounded Microsoft's aspiration of domination, and that was enough of an opening for Apple to sweep in with the unix-backed OS X operating system just after the millennium. It was a breath of fresh air unlike any other. I dumped my Sony Vaio and tall beige PC tower as soon as I got my hands on one of those beautiful, white iBooks running OS X 10.1 Puma. Actually, it was more than a breath of fresh air. It felt like a release and a rebellion at once. A way to finally put action behind all those years of gritted teeth. A way to finally say: Fuck you, Microsoft. It was satisfying. Very, very satisfying. And that satisfaction accrued largely to Apple. I became a ferocious advocate for the Mac. First converting nearly my entire class at university, then doing my best to convert as many developers in the growing web community soon after. Apple was in our corner. Apple was our escape. Oh how the world has turned. I guess you either die a hero (salute Commodore) or you live long enough to become the villain (hello Apple). So here we are twenty years later. Apple has planted all the same seeds of discord with developers as Microsoft did in the 90s. But somehow even more ruthlessly and greedy than the boss that came before it. What a story arc. But the story ain't over yet. Seemingly every competition authority and every legislature around the world has an open antitrust case into Apple. The weekly €5 million fines in The Netherlands are stacking up while the American congress is about to discuss the biggest app store reform package we've ever seen and individual states from Arizona to Illinois continue to push ahead with their own laws. The momentum here far outstrips that facing Microsoft in the late 90s from the DOJ, but Apple is also a far bigger beast than Redmond was back then. At the same time, we may actually stand at the cusp of the kind of tectonic plate shift that the web and Apple's unix-backed OS X provided in the early 2000s. Maybe it's the metaverse, maybe it's web3, maybe it's Microsoft staging a comeback as the Sith Lord that became a Jedi. It feels like there's some electric energy in the air. And when that happens, if it happens, there'll be thousands upon thousands of developers ready. With their gritted teeth. Who had been bidding their time. To say those magic, releasing words of someone finally free: Fuck you, Apple. We're done. Then we'll get the answer of what those developer relationships were worth as a retrospect. And who knows, maybe one day we'll see a redeemed Cook dancing around a podium with sweaty hands clapping DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS. DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS.

After a decade's worth of front-end progress kept demanding ever more complicated setups, we're finally moving in the opposite direction. With simpler tools that are still able to hit those high-fidelity user interface notes, but at a sliver of the cost in complexity. The long expansion of enabling concepts is now at last being compressed for human comprehension. Hallelujah! And like with expanding complexity, where one complication often leads to another, compressing complexity also cascades. In our modern asset world, JavaScript and stylesheets are either That's a lot, so Sprockets grew large to handle all these responsibilities, but also spread itself thin. It's hard to keep up with the state of the art on all these fronts at once, and while valiant attempts were made, it kept falling behind on everything from Sass compilation to understanding ESM dependencies. So far we've just routed around these deficiencies. The core of Sprockets still adequately serves Rails 7 as the default setup for providing a load path, digesting assets, and handling the outputs from other bundlers and transpilers. But it's doing so carrying an awful lot of baggage in the form of unused pipelines and underdeveloped features. That's where Propshaft comes in. It was written on a clean sheet of paper to carry only what we need in the year of our lord 2022. A realm with HTTP/2, ES6, import maps, and a mature set of standalone transpilers and bundlers. Not surprisingly, it's absolutely tiny compared to Sprockets. Which means simpler to understand, fewer moving parts that can break, and conceptually tighter. At its core, Propshaft seeks to provide just the configurable load path where assets can live in app/assets, lib/assets, vendor/assets, and inside of gems, alongside the digest stamping and URL rewriting needed for far-future cache expiration. All this accessible through either static precompilation in production or a thin dynamic server in development. There's still more work to be done on Propshaft before it's fully able to take over the reins from Sprockets as the default asset pipeline in Rails, but we're fast moving closer. You can start new Rails 7 applications directly on Propshaft rather than Sprockets with \"rails new -a propshaft myapp\" or The biggest hurdle is likely to be that many gems are written to depend on Sprockets offering everything from CoffeeScript to Sass compilation out of the box. Those gems will need to be updated or we'll need to find ways of offering backwards compatibility. This isn't a quick migration, and there's no prospect of considering Propshaft as the new default until Rails 8. But it's really exciting to see how when we manage to make one aspect of Rails dramatically simpler (bye-bye Webpacker), we can often make another part much simpler too (hello Propshaft). The battle against complexity in web development is a constant tug of war. We give a little to get something new, we take it back to make it simpler. Progress is good. Complexity is a bridge. Simplicity is the destination.

Here's the director of the Danish Health Authority explaining why Denmark never saw broad vaccine mandates as a viable option:I do not believe in imposed vaccine mandates. It’s a pharmaceutical intervention with possible side effects. I think if you push too much, you will have a reaction. Action generates reaction, especially with vaccines. \"Action generates reaction\" indeed. Doubly foolish is this punitive push for a mandate now given the fact that over 90% of Canadian truckers are already vaccinated. And that omicron doesn't seem to discriminate much if at all between vaccinated and unvaccinated in its spread. So forcing truckers who don't want to get vaccinated to be so on the penalty of losing their livelihood will do nothing to alter the trajectory of the pandemic, but it sure will radicalize the truckers! Yet this is what's beyond the pale to even engage to discuss? That Canadian truckers would like to see their country follow in the footsteps of Denmark and other nations who don't mandate vaccines as a condition to work? What a bizarre abdication of political responsibility. You don't even have to believe that the truckers have a point in asking for Danish conditions to see that labeling their protests an \"occupation\" is histrionic, though. It's that same escalation of language that has seen words like insurrectionists and traitors thrown around with abandonment in regard to American political events. Or the expansion of trauma to encompass all degrees of emotional distress. Or that fantasizing that maybe THE RUSSIANS are behind this is a bad replay of the American obsession with #Russiagate. The right to peaceful protest does not have an expiration date. A healthy democracy will engage with protesters to hear their claims and consider their voice within the guardrails of peaceful expression.

Their first attempt would literally have re-routed donations for the truckers to “other charities”. That sounded so crazy when I first read it that I had to dig up multiple confirming sources to believe it to be true. But true enough it was! Thankfully, this original plan was revised after Gofundme got some “donor feedback”, including from the likes of Elon Musk (what a timeline we’re living in!). The new plan will “just” block the donations from reaching their intended recipients, and result in refunds 7-10 days(!!) from now. What a conveniently long time to keep $10 million locked up, and unable to support the protesting truckers. The original confiscation of funds came at the behest of the Ottawa city (via its police). As best as I can tell, without any court order to back it up. Meaning Gofundme acted as a voluntary extension of the local government that’s on the other side of this political conflict. This is an eery echo of how certain US politicians and institutions have been using/pressuring tech platforms to be their enforcement arm in political disputes. And how it in that case clearly appears to be a violation of the US constitution, as repeatedly asserted by the Supreme Court: The government can’t circumvent the 1st amendment by having private actors carry out the censorship on their behalf. But somehow this seems worse. It’s one thing to take down someone’s words, quite another to take their money. Having the freedom to support political organizations of your choice with your own money seems like a fundamental one in a democracy. The organization Black Lives Matter, for example, raised $90 million during 2020, and is now in hot water with the state of California, amongst others, over failures to account for the money. All allegations of financial misconduct should of course be fully investigated, but surely people were in their good right to make these donations in the first place? Could you imagine the outcry if Gofundme, or any other donation platform or financial institution, had blocked Black Lives Matter from raising money during the summer of 2020? Because some of the protests started in their name turned into violent riots? Hell, donations from these fundraisers were occasionally used to bail out some of these rioters! Gofundme even featured a donation drive to recipients part of the Seattle occupation known as CHOP that followed from the protests. Lord knows I’ve been highly skeptical and critical of crypto. But actions like these from Gofundme make a very strong case for why we need an apolitical protocol of money transfer when the existing channels are so liable to petty political capture. That goes whether you’re donating to Canadian truckers, Black Lives Matter, Palestinians, or the NRA. You don’t have to agree with any of these causes or organizations to understand that politicizing our basic platforms for charity or finance is a terrible idea. But this is the slope we’re sliding down when terms like “domestic terrorists” are expanded to include Canadian truckers and parents at school board meetings. Then sanctions imagined only for “terrorists” suddenly become reasonable and fair game for a much broader group. This is not the way.", "date": "2022-02-05T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

One that grants themselves the right to audit the books of any developer who dares refuse Apple's own in-app payment system, still collects a preposterous 27% of the economic activity, and mandates a scary-sounding disclaimer to discourage users from even trying it. Yowza! Here's how Apple lays out the framework that'll govern the economic and operating punishment that exactly nobody would ever in their right mind volunteer for (my emphasis): Consistent with the ACM’s order, dating apps that are granted an entitlement to link out or use a third-party in-app payment provider will pay Apple a commission on transactions. Apple will charge a 27% commission on the price paid by the user, net of value-added taxes. This is a reduced rate that excludes value related to payment processing and related activities. Developers will be responsible for the collection and remittance of any applicable taxes, such as the Netherlands’ value-added tax (VAT), for sales processed by a third-party payment provider. Developers using these entitlements will be required to provide a report to Apple recording each sale of digital goods and content that has been facilitated through the App Store. This report will need to be provided monthly within 15 calendar days following the end of Apple’s fiscal month. To learn about the details that will need to be included in the report, view an example report. Qualifying developers will receive an invoice based on the reporting and will be required to remit payment to Apple for the amount invoiced within 45 days following the end of Apple’s fiscal month. In the future, if Apple develops technical solutions to facilitate reporting, developers will be required to adopt such technologies. Please note that Apple has audit rights pursuant to the entitlement’s terms and conditions. This will allow Apple to review the accuracy of a developer’s record of digital transactions as a result of the entitlement, ensuring the appropriate commission has been paid to Apple. Failure to pay Apple’s commission could result in the offset of proceeds owed to you in other markets, removal of your app from the App Store or removal from the Apple Developer program. While this package is clearly Apple just giving the Dutch authorities the middle finger, it also reveals a road map that could be driven far beyond The Netherlands. By granting themselves audit rights 'pursuant to the entitlement's terms and conditions', they've shown how they can apply their 27% tax to any developer's economic activity at will. Under the threat of App Store expulsion – with the subsequent ruin of any platform-dependent business – they don't even need a technical solution to collection. Coerced reporting requirements together with monthly invoices might be old school, but it'll work just fine. It's a small hop from there to amending the App Store guidelines globally such that this new tax regime will apply to all apps, from all businesses. If Facebook thought it was tough to deal with the $10 billion/year loss from Apple's ATT, it'll be absolutely nothing compared to the pain associated with a monthly invoice for 27% of the economic value derived from anyone using Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp on an iPhone. Apple has, perhaps inadvertently, just revealed to the world how they might go from a three-trillion dollar company to a hundred-trillion dollar company. Just send every business dependent on an app a demand to audit their books, then mail them an invoice for 27% of their economic activity.", "date": "2022-02-04T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

And that’s why some of my ideas are not that prepared or fleshed out because I’m literally having them in real time, but I do my best and they’re just conversations, and I think that’s also the appeal of the show. It’s one of the things that makes it interesting. Yes! Fucking yes! The spontaneity is indeed key to the appeal. That's what makes it feel like a conversation rather than a deposition. There's a time and a place for depositions, and there are plenty of journalists pursuing those, but that's not this show. This is a spontaneity that relies on intuition, flow, and open mindedness. Not studious preparation. And herein lies the crime. Because there are other people who do far more work than Rogan to prepare for their podcasts, but they don't have millions of listeners? How is that *fair*? They Did The Work! This is the confusion of the novice. Conflating effort with value. Nobody is listening to your show because of how much effort you put into it. They listen because they find it funny, interesting, illuminating, or otherwise valuable. Sometimes those things come as a product of studious effort, but other times they do not. Millions of listeners have chosen that they like these conversations. Not in spite of the off-the-cuff approach, but *because*of it.

Focused primarily on the concrete 'imminent threat' principle. Thus making it clear whether a violation has happened or not.

Here's how they express their frustration: These guidelines seemingly allow podcasters to say the vaccines cause death — just not that they are designed to cause death. Similarly, they allow podcasters to say wearing a mask is ineffective, just not that wearing masks will cause imminent, life-threatening harm. First, vaccines have caused deaths! The Danish state pulled AstraZeneca from the official vaccine program after several deaths occurred from rare but fatal side effects. The family of the victims were awarded compensation from the state as a result of these deaths. In Norway, four deaths were linked to the same vaccine, and the Norwegian state also removed AstraZeneca from the official vaccine program as a result. Second, wearing some masks has also been shown to be ineffective in a variety of settings (like with kids and schools). Thus the new push for N95s. And let's not forget that at the start of the pandemic, it was official US policy that masks didn't work. Should podcasters really be banned from discussing either of these phenomenon? It didn't turn out well when the lab leak theory was banned from social media, only to be allowed once it became clear that the 'conspiracy theory' label was applied prematurely. I was in Denmark when the AstraZeneca vaccine was pulled from the official program as a result of the deaths. It was naturally a topic of intense national debate: Yes, the risk of death was low, but pushing on by downplaying these deaths might well have harmed the overall trust in vaccines even more. Arguments went back and forth for weeks in radio, tv, and online. Would Danes really have been better off if the discussion of rare but real vaccine deaths were banned from the media? That seems very hard to believe. Kudos to the Swedish leadership at Spotify for reaching the same conclusion. Tack så mycke!", "date": "2022-01-29T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

What's new, or what has intensified due to [novel power leaks](https://graymirror.substack.com/p/big-tech-has-no-power-at-all), is that these fights have focused so heavily on the guerrilla warfare of suppressing speech. What we can't beat with compelling counter speech, we will threaten, extort, or slander our way to exorcising! But the \"we\" in this sense is virtually always a small, loud minority with a completely inflated sense of purpose and power. (I should know. I've been in such a minority on plenty of causes over the years 😂). This inflation is directly proportional to the righteous, moral fever that is whipped up. OH NO! What if some innocent simpleton out there listens to Rogan describe his own covid recovery, and then they get omicron, and then they DIE. What about that, hu? HU?! Won't somebody please think of the [ [The Simpsons Did It First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RybNI0KB1bg)]! What's so interesting about this particular fight is how obvious the prospect of it being lost were from the outset. Like the last attempt to cancel Chapelle at Netflix. If you're going to take on the number one music or video streaming service together with the number one podcaster or comedian, you damn well better come packing more heat than I Don't Like What They're Saying! Not just because that would make for a more compelling argument in the individual cases, but also because every loss you take in the forum of public opinion sets you up worse for the next attempt. The guaranteed failure to cancel Chapelle or Rogan over these inane speech prohibitions will weaken every future attempt to cancel less resilient figures. This is just basic Sun Tzu strategy! But this of course returns to [McWhorter's key observation](https://www.amazon.com/Woke- Racism-Religion-Betrayed-America/dp/0593423062): These cancelation attempts are not the product of political movements trying to mobilize mass coalitions on the basis of compelling shared goals. They're religious incantations meant to bless those who condemn. \"Winning\", as it were, is not the primary objective. Which I guess is some kind of wicked consolation. Given how long the odds of doing so in these cases are. Meanwhile, the Streisand effect continues to reverb across the realm. Every swing at the king that misses only serves to highlight his glory. Ohhh, this Rogan fellow must really be on to something, if they're that desperate to get him canceled! SUBSCRIBED! And the injury to the inquisition is then twofold when all these new Streisand subscribers find a curious, broad interviewer who brings on a wide variety of interesting people to talk about their ideas. With barely an iota of the drama that was promised. Thus ensuring all these folks who showed up for the shock will convert on the awe.

The distance from emotion to reaction has been whittled away one A/B test at the time, and there's barely any left. You don't even have to portray any original sentiment today, just like or retweet that of someone else, and you'll be microdosing on that sweet rush of belonging. We know it too! Celebrate it, even! Have you seen that new thing that just went viral? SAVAGE. Yes, this level of virulent spread is savage. Because it's literally been engineered in a lab to be so. All our natural human defenses have been studied by machines learning, and are now effectively and consistently evaded. No wonder this meta virus has taken over key parts of society. But you know this too. There's been a billion articles decrying this beast and they've all been turned into feed for it. Every SOCIAL MEDIA IS BAD headline digested, regurgitated, and shat out to millions of followers. A savage cycle of success indeed. This recurring loop has brought me more than a little down on the internet over the past few years. Because it's so easy to equate the two. Social media is the black hole that seemingly swallows up all discourse, people, and good intentions on the internet. And how do you escape the gravity of that, exactly? You could stay far away from the event horizon, but then you're floating alone in space. Sure, nobody there to endlessly echo and amplify the screams, but nobody there to hear yours either. We need others enough that even if they become these warped beings, pulled apart by the black hole, they're still preferable to the cold emptiness of being alone. This dilemma is difficult enough that many have simply given up. Yes, it's terrible, but whatcha gonna do? I've stood on the that ledge plenty of times, then knowingly walked into the drop. At least falling is a rush until you hit the ground! Then I was blessed with a properly hard hit last April. A revelation of the obvious while in the center of a storm. Like an alcoholic hitting the same bottom of the same brand of booze as a million souls before them, but needing that individual crash to translate the universal wisdom of recovery into a personal journey. And like many recovering addicts, the final act of bottoming out appears in retrospect as a gift from the gods. If only it could have been this bad sooner! But no matter, thank heavens it finally hit. Thus I was moved to retire from engaging with my social drug of choice, Twitter. After tens of thousands of tweets across more than a decade, I vowed to stop responding to – let alone arguing with – strangers in that particular thunderdome of despair. And like all recovering addicts who now wax lyrically about the healing power of their perpetuating intervention – be that Jesus, the group session, the gardening, or whatever – I fight to restrain myself from breaking out in song about the gospel all the time. (Because there really is nothing more annoying than a born-again sinner serenading from the soapbox.) But now that it's been a while, I still thought I'd share what has worked for me. To prevent a relapse, I've replaced the free-for-all of the thunderdome with connections mediated by friction. The kind of friction the internet had since its inception, but that has been outrun by the virulence of the frictionless social media variants. The most important of these mediated connections have been through email. Both sending it, like this, but also receiving it from the small minority of readers who The second most important has been open source tickets on GitHub. Collaborating with strangers toward a common goal of improving some software. Seeing how people who've never met can find common cause in their desire to make something better, despite the fact that they may disagree on all manner of core values outside of this shared space. That's been a real reminder that work can unite what politics so often divide. And again, it's restoring my faith in those connections with strangers. Common between both modes of connection is that they're virtually stripped of virulence. While an open source ticket may occasionally garner outside attention from spectators, the vast majority do not. They simply facilitate the connection between truly engaged individuals, not for the sake of engagement, but for the sake of the facilitation. But even more crucially is the friction that underpin these forms of exchange. For someone to write me a reply to something I've written on email requires original thought (you don't get to see other replies), and an intrinsic motivation based in genuine curiosity (there's no quick hit of belonging). Thus unlocking the kind of human connections we all in theory say we want: Authentic, good-faith, and considerate. This friction serves as a high-grade filter. Cleaning the feedback of the frivolous and the malevolent. Out of the thousands of people who might read something I write about antitrust, vaccines, polarization, hiring, or whatever, most will probably have some type of reaction. Maybe they're appreciative, maybe they're annoyed, maybe they're ecstatic, maybe they're outraged. But in almost all cases, I won't ever know! These are thoughts and feelings that simply stay in the head and heart of the reader, never to manifest in any form of internet engagement that I'll be privy to. The same too is true of these open source tickets. Out of the hundreds of thousands of people who might use Rails, or any of the associated projects that I work on, most will never contribute code or bug reports. They too may be thrilled or dismayed at having to work with something I created, but at least as mediated through these tickets, I'll rarely if ever know. Those reactions just stay inside the folks who have them. This dynamic reminds me of Madilyn Bailey's In the days of yore, the gates of friction defending an artist's mind were formidable. What, you were going to write some fan club mailing address a letter to say \"Madilyn, your voice is very, very, very bad!\"? No, no you were not. And if you did, you'd come across as positively psychotic to anyone you told about that. But with the social medias, nobody even bats an eye when thousands of such comments flood the feedback streams. What I'm getting at here is that friction is a feature! Whittling it all away such that every little impulse of every little person is connected to an outlet of expression is perhaps the worst crime committed by the modern internet, as dominated by social media as it is. I've flirted with this idea of increasing friction on social media several times over the years. Well before I was blessed with the confidence from a crisis to follow through on its conclusions. And the response (on said social medias!) I'd mostly get would be: BUT THIS IS THE POINT! THIS IS WHY I LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA! THE POWER TO INVADE SOMEONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE KILLER APP. Okay, usually it wouldn't be quite as explicit as that last line, but that would be the summation. Democratizing the power to force your way into someone's head is intoxicating. No wonder some of those lacking in appeal to voluntarily attract the interest of others find that compelling. But we really are all better off when creating a connection to another human being is gated by a modicum of friction. This is true on both sides of that connection. Giving voice to every fleeting emotion or thought is a pathology. Listening to all these voices sure to eventually develop into one. Now I don't have high hopes that these existing choices for mediating connections with friction are likely to see a big resurgence. Although to a limited extend they kinda have, in the form of email newsletters and podcasting. But a broad epiphany stand little chance against social media in a trial by combat. I do, though, have the hope that new mediated forms can arise from the wisdom of friction. Like Tinder did. The magic of Tinder is exactly the friction it introduced between who'd be able to write whom. Unless a two-way connection is made, there'll be no initiation. That was a profound discovery, or at least popularization, within this friction paradigm. We've copied this insight with What would a social media design that embraced friction look like? Is it even possible? Could it ever compete against the virality of the existing frictionless alternatives? Those seem like exciting, novel questions for the internet to answer. I don't think it's going to get better before we get some of those answers either. It seems like we're in a spiral at the moment. It also seems clear to me that the answer is not content moderation or \"fact checking\". Those approaches have been tried, tested, and But while we wait for these new answers, it's going to be a hard sell to convince others to exit the circle. I had plenty of doubts, plenty of fears, and they were left lingering for years. It wasn't until that spring storm shook the foundation that I was compelled into action. That's not a scalable recipe for redemption! So I don't write to convince you of anything, really. I at most write to comfort you that if you too have unresolved doubts about how we're mediating human connections, you're not alone. We don't even have to agree on a solution to share the diagnosis.

These new requirements are somewhat oddly contained to just dating apps, as they came as a consequence of a specific complaint from a specific provider, but even with that seriously restrictive caveat, Apple has chosen to blow them off. Because this is just the cost of doing business! The five million euro fine is the first of potentially ten such weekly fines, which will come due if Apple continues to violate the new requirements (like allowing Dutch dating apps the right to link out of app for payment). But as Daring Fireball points out, €50 million is 'spare-change-under-the-sofa' money for Apple, a company that literally makes a billion dollars per day in revenue. This is the problem with fines. They put a price on criminal behavior, and if the gains from committing those crimes exceed the cost of the fines, there's a base hyper-rational calculus that says the company should continue to break the law. I don't necessarily disagree with the basic incentives here. Fines should be sufficient to deter violations (and these surely are not). But I also have some sympathy with the Dutch authorities. The normal rules of commerce, competition, and regulation just don't apply when you're dealing with a trillion-dollar global behemoth like Apple. For whom a €50 million fine is chump change. What'll be curious to see now is whether Apple will embrace this calculus, and the odious cape of contempt that comes with it. Because while that might make sense in the short term, there's just no way this is the last stop.

It prevents the company from making any credible claim of an impending security catastrophe, if lawmakers Worse still, Apple continues to brag about this solid security record for the Mac the iPhone to allow installation of apps without the App Store. With the Mac, we have almost forty years of proof that computers don't need an App Store to be safe. Made by the same company that now tries to pretend to legislators that this isn't possible! Worse still, Apple continues to brag about this solid security record for the Mac when they try to sell you a new computer while their lobbyists argue the opposite on Capitol Hill. Here's how the company presents the Mac as a fortress when it comes to apps installed without the Mac App Store: Gatekeeper on your Mac ensures that all apps from the internet have already been checked by Apple for known malicious code — before you run them the first time. If there’s ever a problem with an app, Apple can quickly stop new installations and even block the app from launching again. This is a strong argument because it's been backed up by the experience of regular Mac users for decades. This is not a platform overrun by malware, scams, and villainy. It's a thriving, modern computing platform that relies on technical security measures to counter the threats to computing rather than hurried human review. Furthermore, it's proof that choice works! Choice for users, choice for developers. If users believe they're better off only installing software directly from the Mac App Store, they're free to do so. If developers think they're better off distributing their software exclusively via the Mac App Store, they can do so too. But if either of them chose not to, that's their prerogative, and things have been working out just fine! We've indeed chosen not to distribute our Mac apps for Basecamp and HEY via the Mac App Store. We distribute these apps directly via our websites. And our users are choosing in droves to download these apps. Just like users do with the fine products made by small independent shops like Panic or huge makers like Adobe. Apple of course knows this is true. That the Mac, with its free choice for developers and users, is a thriving computing platform. They highlight the ever-higher sales all the time! This cognitive dissonance forces them into some bizarre logical contortions as to why this proven model of choice can't work for the iPhone. Let's address some of them: The iPhone is special because it keeps more sensitive data than a normal computer. It does? Isn't Apple's whole pitch for its ecosystem that you have all your data available on all your devices? That your Mac and your iPhone share access to the same emails, same iMessages, same contacts, same calendars, same notes, same files, SAME EVERYTHING? Yes, it is. Which means that this argument is just utter bunk. Your computer is just as crucial to protect as your phone. iPhone users are less sophisticated than computer users so they need more protections. They are? Who are these unsophisticated rubes who'll be exploited if they're given access to a platform with the same application installation process as every other computer ever made? Kids? We already have parental controls for them. This is demeaning nonsense. The iPhone isn't actually a computer, it's a phone. Apple loves to compare the iPhone with a full-fledged computer when they need to sell you on why it's such a revolution over the past. And they love to compare it to the locked-down feature phones sold by American telecoms prior to 2007 when they have to defend their extractive business practices. At least we're not as bad as those guys! Sorry, but there's no logical refugee in at least we're not Verizon anno 2005! The fact is that the iPhone is already a considerably more secure device than even the Mac! Apps run in a tighter sandbox, and everything is far more locked down than traditional computers. This is where the defense against malware rests, along with the kill-switch power to nix any app that exploit novel vulnerabilities to escape detection up front. The only thing these technical defenses can't guard against is business model threats. That's why Apple employs thousands of people in the App Store review department without any technical or security qualifications! Because they're not there to uncover security threats, only threats to the faucet of monopoly rents. And they're very good at that, because even when they fail to detect a scam, Apple still takes a cut. It's win-win for Apple, lose-lose for consumers and developers. Despite the inherent contradictions in the argument that the iPhone would suffer a security catastrophe if it worked like the Mac, it's not hard to understand why Apple is making it. There are no other arguments to make! Nobody but the most hardened Apple sycophants would have any sympathy for an argument that their new $1,000 iPhone can't install the software of their choice, lest its developer surrenders to the 30% stickup. Trillion-dollar monopolists just don't garner support from a naked attempt to pick the pockets of independent developers. So this security nonsense is the only option for Apple.

He focused in a relatively sober tone on the sanctity of Apple's integration and curation as arguments for why they deserved their monopoly privileges. A technical witness perhaps stretching the truth to fit the narrative needed, but at least feeling somewhat constrained by it. In Arizona, Apple sent Kyle Andeer, the Chief Compliance Offer, to claim that preventing Apple from shaking down app developers for 30% would be tantamount to 'a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store' because it would 'allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free'. This was a considerably more spurious line of arguments than Neuenschwander had advanced in North Dakota, but, still, at least it stuck to arguing the economics of the situation, no matter how corrupt. Now that Apple is facing a concrete antitrust bill in Congress, they've sent their biggest baller of bullshit yet to dribble with the legislature. In a letter to the Senate Justice Committee, Timothy Powderly, Apple's senior director of government affairs, sent this cross-court shoot to oppose sensible regulation: If Apple is forced to enable sideloading, millions of Americans will likely suffer malware attacks on their phones that would otherwise have been stopped. Millions of Americans are going to be subject to malware if the iPhone must work like the Mac? Allowing the buyers of thousand-dollar smartphones to install the software of their choice, like they do on their laptop and desktop computers, would be a novel catastrophe of computing? That's just preposterous hyperbole. It's clear that as Apple has progressed from offering testimony provided by first someone technical, then by someone on policy, and finally by a unapologetically political beast, the nonsense has escalated to embarrassing, insulting levels. This seems to be a conscious escalation in line with the way Apple is making a mockery of the South Korean government and the Dutch competition authorities. Both of which passed laws and rendered judgement on the question of whether Apple was entitled to force developers to hand over 30% of their revenue to the company on digital transactions. Apple, along with Google, has gambled that by technically allowing developers to charge a credit card through a different processor, but retaining the right to extract their obscene cut and eviction privileges under new names, they'll be in compliance with the letter of the law, even as they violate its spirit and intention. Take this story on Apple's response to the Dutch competition authorities by whom they were handed a clear if narrow demand: No more forcing dating app developers to pay your obscene take! To which Apple responded, like Google in South Korea, that sure, they'll allow such apps to run transactions through their own payment processor, but it'll still be through Apple's APIs so they can monitor all payment flows, and they'll just take their cut as a 'platform fee' instead of a 'payment fee'. Rendering the entire exercise to allow developers competitive options moot, and making a fool out of the Dutch. It's a clear sign that monopoly power has metastasized when it feels this confident in its ability to mock and embarrass the democratic institutions that it in theory must answer to. The practice of trillion-dollar might is that it'll yield political rights too. Which of course is the classical warning about letting monopoly power grow unchecked: Eventually it's not just about the capture of economics, but soon too the capture of politics. And for every state senate Apple and Google is able to bully into submission, like they did in North Dakota and Arizona, their sense of invulnerability will grow. Of course they'll continue to think they're above the law when the legislatures keep backing down when the lobbyists swarm town. As with oil, railroads, trusts, and telecoms, the fight against monopoly capture is the fight against a many-headed hydra. Even if you cut off one head with a new law, it might well grow back two heads of new transgressions. That's what we've seen so far in South Korea and The Netherlands. Developers extraordinarily end up worse than were they were, if they try to take advantage of the statutory relief they were granted by lawmakers and regulators. But as with any video game, when the bosses get harder, it means you're closer to the end. Keep fighting, keep lawmaking, keep regulating. The level of contempt is darkest before the dawn.

The book was recommended to me by a reader who replied to my earlier post about The thrill of changing your mind, and that's probably why it resonated so immediately with me. I too am liable to fall into soldier thinking, but my most satisfying intellectual moments are when the inner scout is in charge.", "date": "2022-01-17T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

It detailed how many of the tactics and thought processes anyone who came of age in the 90s would recognize as 'of the right' are now being used by the opposite side of the political spectrum. A clip: Conservatives once tried to legislate what went on in your bedroom; now it’s the left that obsesses over sexual codicils, not just for the bedroom but everywhere. Right-wingers from time to time made headlines campaigning against everything from The Last Temptation of Christ to 'Fuck the Police,' though we laughed at the idea that Ice Cube made cops literally unsafe, and it was understood an artist had to do something fairly ambitious, like piss on a crucifix in public, to get conservative protesters off their couches. He goes on to list a series of absurd instances of this bizarre swapperoo. But that was last year. Have things gotten better since? Maybe on some counts. We now have people like John McWhorter who have entered the mainstream with an opposition to 'wokeness' that would have been chased out of polite center-left company a year prior. We also saw an astounding political upset in Virginia over school policy that probably wouldn't have happened in 2020. But in other ways, it seems like we're still regressing. Take this latest obsession with Joe Rogan. There seems to be very little curiosity into why he's become this huge phenomenon, and an almost blood-thirsty zeal to get him kicked off Spotify for daring to do what he does. Which is having curious conversations with a huge range of folks and letting them talk. A style in which he walks the path of William Buckley, Bryan Magee, and plenty of other interviewers who weren't afraid of letting their political or intellectual adversaries present their arguments. The latest brouhaha is over an interview he conducted with Dr Robert Malone, a noted covid vaccine skeptic, who also happen to have been intimately involved with developing the underlying mRNA technology. I'm not going to litigate any of the specific claims here, because I think it's besides the broader point. Which is: What is science, if not an adversarial process by which we seek an ever-closer understanding of the truth through critical review from all sides? How can we follow The Science, if we do not subject it to such pressures? What kind of science do we get if we don't? What's so dizzying about this quest to cancel Rogan is who it's coming from. I remember reading about the campaign to ban NWA in the 90s. Seeing the throwbacks to 'this is your brain on drugs' PSAs from the 80s applied to weed. The Moral Majority type stuff. It was not only coming from the other side, but it was laughed at by liberals and progressives as preposterous. It's possible some of this is generational. I'm sure plenty of people like me who were kids in those 90s also chuckled a bit about the hippies from the 60s, even if they broadly shared the same political vision. But it's not all of it. Things have shifted. Drastically and quickly. Maybe in a year from now, the winds will start blowing in the opposite direction again, though. Like with McWhorter and 'wokeness'. The idea that a podcast host should be fired if he interviews the wrong people with the wrong opinions thrown back into the bin of bad propositions. Let's hope so. In the meanwhile, I can't help but chuckle at how this outrage is performing the same function for Rogan that picketing parents did for Eminem: MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO LISTEN! It's like seeing Dungeon & Dragons being ripped off the shelves in the 80s from preachers proclaiming it to be a gateway to Satan. The more you tell people how dangerous this music/game/interview is, the more appealing it'll appear to many. It's basic human nature!", "date": "2022-01-14T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Between Guy Bedford's excellent shim and native support in Chrome 89, we've finally been granted an escape from a decade's worth of frustrating complexity with excess tooling. Usually progress means more to learn, more to master. It's not often we get to celebrate the progress of true conceptual compression, so when we do, the confetti is well deserved. Hurrah for import maps! Thus I'm thrilled to announce that HEY has been running on import maps in production for the past two weeks, and the experience has been bliss. An entire class of problems flushed from the daily development experience. WOOSH. This work had been months underway. First, I used HEY as the testbed to validate the aspiration for import maps to become the default path in Rails 7. This is the benefit of using new tech in anger: You discover all the gaps between exuberant theory and actual practice. Second, after proving that import maps work well on the web, we turned our eye to reworking several aspects of the TurboNative integration. Especially dealing with the timing difference of loading all JavaScript after DOMContentLoaded. That's how all module loading in the browser is done, so we had to adapt. Not a big deal, but with a large codebase like HEY, and the criticality at stake, it still took a fair bit of diligence. HEY is a major app. In total, it's almost fifty thousand lines of code, even if JavaScript only constitutes about 10% of that. It's also got tens of thousands of paying customers, and pulls in millions of dollars in revenue. We cover seven platforms with native apps on iPhone, iPad, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, and of course the web. If we can make HEY work well with import maps, you can make the vast majority of all apps work well with import maps. That was always the test for me. I'm not interested in pursuing an approach that only works for some small subsection of modern apps. Certainly not as a default approach for Rails. This has to stand the test of production with a major app. And it's this test it's passed with flying colors. What a relief! The early feedback from Rails 7 adopters has also been strikingly positive, which too is a relief! Going with import maps by default felt like it might be a huge gamble when I started the work in early 2021. We'd been working with the old Webpack integration for almost five years. The devil you know and all that. But this is the reward of taking a leap. Having people realize that the slow boil of complexity they'd been steaming in wasn't inherent to doing great, modern web applications. And when they got to experience a different way, it proved a revelation. I hear through the grapevine that this success with import maps we've shown via Rails is changing minds elsewhere in the industry. Could we see native support in Firefox soon? Maybe even Safari? I think we just might. But again, thanks to Guy's impeccable work, we don't have to wait. Import maps are ready today. HEY has proven that beyond any doubt.", "date": "2022-01-14T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Especially if the topic had been one left unquestioned for a long time. To me, it feels similar to the rush of solving a hard problem. When the pieces suddenly fit into place, and an elegant solution emerges, you can't help but smile. Take nuclear power. I vividly remember the stickers from the 80s opposing it. Even looking them today, it brings warm and fuzzy memories. Together with that era's activism, like the Further more, it seemed like a settled question: The future of energy is wind and solar!

And fundraising as a kid for the Brazilian rain forest.Further more, it seemed like a settled question: The future of energy is wind and solar! Of course it is. Renewables with no downsides, right? Wrong. Michael Shellenberger's exposition of energy sources in Apocalypse Never was as argumentatively piercing as it was intellectually compelling. It goes something like this:- Wind and solar are unreliable sources of energy. The sun doesn't always shine, the wind doesn't always blow. But electrical grids need dependable sources of power to perform reliably and cheaply. - Batteries can't solve the problem at scale. The sheer footprint needed to bridge the gap in production from renewables is enormous and unrealistic with present-day technology. - When wind and solar fails to deliver the power needed, you need on-demand backup sources. Most of these sources today are extra dirty emitters like coal power plants. - Thus, if you over-invest in wind and solar, you may end up with a power grid that's simultaneously expensive, unreliable, dirty, and without sovereignty. The case study is Germany, which is now at the mercy of Russian natural gas, after spending billions over the years chasing wind and solar. - Besides, wind in particular is not without its own ecological drawbacks. Wind parks can wreck havoc on the migration paths of certain bird species. They take up a lot of space. (And they're a blight for the people who have to live right next to them.) Solar has a serious waste problem. Panels recycle poorly, are full of toxic materials, and often end up in 3rd world landfills. That doesn't mean wind and solar can't be or shouldn't be part of the answer for dealing with climate change. But it does mean that betting on them exclusively is a bad idea. And that their use is not without its own problems. Enter nuclear power. An energy source that also emits no earth-heating gasses, provides an abundance of predictable power, and has done so for decades. Countries like France already get 70% of their power from nuclear. The nuclear waste generated can be stored on-site, and the waste needed for a single person's lifetime energy consumption can fit in a coke can. But what about Chernobyl? Three Mile Island? Fukushima? Shellenberger examines all these well-known accidents in detail, and compellingly concludes that the total number of deaths associated is but a pittance compared to all these other energy sources we're using on the daily. Their impact has largely been drawn from the spectacle of disaster. And as a result been massively overstated (even if the consequences are very real). It's that contrast I found particularly compelling. That when we weigh the trade offs objectively, nuclear emerges as shining star. Not because there are no risks, but because they are far less than the alternatives. Like comparing flying and driving. Flying is much safer, but when a plane goes down, it's world news, and it freaks some people out. Meanwhile, 35,000 died in car accidents in the US last year. Few people fret about that. It seems that Shellenberger isn't the only one coming to this conclusion. That nuclear power appears to be one of our very best chances at countering climate change, and the historical opposition from environmentalists now looks like a catastrophic error in hindsight. The EU But this goes further than just nuclear. To make progress on a range of topics, we have to be able to change our minds. To revisit our assumptions when the data changes or when a new way of looking at it emerges. This is true whether we talk about energy, vaccines, economics, or politics in general.

It doesn't matter what else is true about you, if your programming chops aren't up to par, there's not going to be a job offer. So far, so uncontroversial, you'd think? But I'm increasingly seeing this basic lean on merit, as the key hiring assessment, becoming contested. Perhaps that started with the broad attempt to discredit meritocracy. The idea that the best not only should rise to the top, but that they deserve to do so. Meritocracy has been criticized from a number of angles. Like maybe the people evaluating the merit don't actually have a clue, and undeserving people who aren't good at what they do never the less rise to the top from chummy relations or pattern-matched personality traits. I can get absolutely behind a criticism like that. The criticism I cannot get behind is the one which claims an injustice if the assessment of merit fails to produce the desired diversity. Whether that distinction is made along the lines of age, gender, race, or any other identity marker. Diversity certainly can be of merit in itself, as the team acquires a broader perspective and more closely resembles its customer base, but not as a displacement for core competency. Contesting the value of merit in hiring isn't limited to tech. There have been calls to But perhaps John McWhorter tackles this question from an interesting perspective in I see the same thing with programmers. If a programmer isn't able to keep up with the bar set by their team, they're going to have a bad time, and so is that team. And it isn't about seniority either. A junior programmer who's showing aptitude and trajectory can work out just fine. It's when someone has hit the steady-state of their career that the trouble is unavoidable. Nobody wants to sit through review after review where their code is being sent back for major revisions time and again. And nobody wants to perform such reviews either. If the gap is too big, it'll eventually swallow up the best intentions, the broadest patience, and the deepest empathy. Leading to the person being reviewed feeling bad about themselves, and the person giving the review being guilty about inflicting such emotions. That does not mean such an individual couldn't prosper somewhere else! That's the crux of McWhorter's argument about matching a student's abilities to a school that fits. Once you're working with others of like capacity, you're going to have a much better time, and accomplish more too. The world needs people and programmers of all sorts of different levels. The majority of front-ends-on-a-database work that employs millions today doesn't exactly ask for geniuses. But perhaps part what underpins this discussion is a growing dispute as to whether people even are on \"different levels\", or if programmers are all mostly the same in skill, just of different identities. (Witness the exasperated eye-rolling at the notion of the 10x programmer in some circles.) That still doesn't change the fact that making people of significantly varying competence work together – when it's not mediated by differences in seniority – is a struggle. And that this struggle can be avoided by making direct assessments of merit a crucial component of the hiring process. So that's what we do at Basecamp. With programmers, we ask the finalists to complete a substantial This opposition has always puzzled me. Which is what brought me to think about the broader opposition to merit testing. But let's just take this as a good-faith objection. First, \"working for free\" makes no sense if the work has no value, which is the case of these assessments. It's not like after someone submits their assignment that we then crack an evil laugh and deploy to production. By their very nature, we already have the answer to these assessments! They're usually extracted from some problem we faced, and solved, in the past. There's no real economic value in a new set of solutions. Second, it seems that most of the people with the most strenuous objections to this assessment of merit wouldn't bat an eye having to spend a day on travel and traditional interviews. Isn't it more fun to exercise your skills and creativity on a technical challenge than to do that? Third, the alternative to direct assessments of merit is usually indirect assessments of merit! Like those pedigree gates. Or those brainteasers. Isn't that worse? Because the alternative is certainly not nothing. And by nothing I mean \"we look at your CV and just have a conversation about work\". That's a complete crapshoot that gives the smoothest talkers the best chance, and is that really the programmers who are most \"deserving\"? However you slice it, it's difficult to hire well. But you can make it substantially easier if you're able to gauge merit from direct observation. Whether that's a blind audition for the orchestra, standardized tests of admission for college, or a take-home test as a programmer. Merit is not a dirty word. Letting everyone have an equal shot is equality of opportunity. Once we veer off that path, we're into the wilderness. May the best candidate get the spot, the admission, or the job.", "date": "2022-01-10T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

We already have more programmers on staff than we've ever had, and we intend to double that crew within the next 12-18 months. We're going all-in on becoming a multi-product business again, and that means hiring the managers needed to to cope with those ambitions.Not just because of this rapid growth on the technical teams, but because the rest of the company is growing along with it. We'll be bigger than we've ever been this January, and before the end of the year, we'll be much bigger still. Wild to think that after almost twenty years in business, we're suddenly on a fast track to crack a hundred employees. It's even more interesting because eight years ago we stood at the same crossroad, and we made a different choice. Back in 2014, we choose to Become Basecamp, and shut off signups to several other successful products because we *didn't*want to grow the company. That still feels like it was the right decision at the time, even if we're making the opposite one now.Well, opposite is a big word. For now we're committing to being a business capable of doing two major products, and that simply requires a much larger crew. Partly because we were already running a very lean operation just with Basecamp, partly because HEY had the most explosive growth of any new product we had ever launched. We choose to freeze the size of the company back in 2014, by shutting off signups to two products and spinning off a third, because we knew there was a tipping point coming. Between 40-60 people, we felt we could get away with having essentially no full-time managers. It was just Jason and I at the executive level, then a crew of working team leads, and then individual contributors. But push beyond that, and it was clear even in 2014 that the lack of middle management wouldn't work. Now that we're consciously pushing through that ceiling, and embracing the larger company, it's clear that we do need some of those full-time managers. We already took the big leap last year by bringing on Elaine as our new COO, and now we're taking another big step with this director of engineering role. But hiring managers is hard! Much harder than hiring individual contributors who can be evaluated in large part on the strength of their individual work. With programmers we do [multi-hour at-home tests](https://m.signalvnoise.com/hiring-programmers-with-a-take-home-test/)for finalists, with designers we hire them to do a week-long project, and with customer support we ask them to answer a couple of tickets. It's incredible how much it helps the hiring process to be able to see someone's actual, real work on a realistic assignment that mirrors what they'd be doing if hired.But what's a take-home assignment for a director of engineering? Or for any manager? I'm sure you can come up with something, but it won't in any way be as representative as it is for those programmers, designers, or customer service representatives. Not that this is exactly a novel problem, but its never the less a real gap when you're used to having realistic work samples be a big part of the equation. It's also a lot more time consuming to do without! We spent fifty-plus hours in interviews with a little over a dozen candidates for the COO position before we hired Elaine. That was incredibly exhausting. Yes, also incredibly satisfying when we finally knew that we had the right candidate, but I wasn't exactly eager to go through that again right away. Elaine has been here for a while now, though. And it's been a real blessing. So now I finally feel we're ready to give it another go.

One where reasonable people can weigh the same trade offs, yet arrive at different conclusions. And, as foreign as that might seem to Americans at the moment, that's largely how this question has been tackled in Denmark in the public forum so far. There are Danish pediatricians arguing that the determining factor should be that kids themselves don't stand to benefit much from the vaccine. That the Danish principle on vaccines has up until this point weighed protecting the vaccinated themselves as the number one goal. And thus Denmark should not recommend the vaccine for kids broadly. Then there are the health authorities saying that regardless of whether the vaccines are likely to help the individual kid, it's important that they get it to keep society going. Having kids out sick or even just confirmed infected is a major disruption (for their education and for the parents having to quarantine with them). Besides, the vaccines are safe, given the data we have so far. This debate is had in the public sphere in good faith. Being eager to vaccinate kids is one reasonable stance, being hesitant to vaccinate kids is another reasonable stance. Ultimately, the choice has been left to the parents without coercion. And this is where it gets interesting. While more than nine out of ten Danish adults are fully vaccinated, only 40% of kids between 5-12 have gotten the first jab, and as of a few days ago, only around 2% had gotten both jabs. This is a country with a very high level of trust in the health authorities (#1 in Europe, I believe). Very little in form of large-scale demonstrations against the pandemic restrictions. With an open and mostly non-contentious political and social debate. And yet the majority of parents of kids under 12 have still so far decided not to vaccinate their kids. One perspective on this could be that Danish parents are simply being irrational. That if just the Danish state pushed harder, perhaps by making life more difficult for the unvaccinated kids and their parents, it would get the compliance it sought. This seems like a common sentiment in certain American circles. But the Danes are explicitly going in the other direction. Even as the health authorities recommend vaccinating kids, they continue to stress that this is an invitation, not a requirement. And the societal debate is full of admonishments to ensure that schools don't end up making unvaccinated kids feel different. That this is a family choice, and everyone needs to respect that. What a contrast to the American public dialogue! Which seems to have dug into the trenches of vaxx v anti-vaxx. With one side seeing the pressure for kids to be vaccinated as tyrannical governmental overreach and the other the failure to vaccinate as an ignorant, possibly evil, sin. Meanwhile, it seems like both societies are still grappling with how to integrate the long-run risk for kids contracting the virus and the latest data on the propensity for vaccinated individuals to contribute to the spread. Here's a chart comparing the proportion of vaccinated v unvaccinated per 100,000 in each group who are currently being infected in Denmark: It's basically an even split. So the vaccines don't appear to do much if anything to prevent someone from contracting the virus, and therefore don't do much to contain the overall spread. That seems to be confirmed by the fact that Denmark has some of the highest vaccination rates in the world, and yet also currently has some of the highest transmission rates in the world. Of course being vaccinated as an adult plays a very significant role in how bad your experience with the virus is likely to be. Proportionally, there are 4x as many unvaccinated people with covid in the hospital in Denmark as there are vaccinated. But again, that's for adults. All reports continue to be that kids are extremely unlikely to have a bad case of corona, particularly if they don't have other underlying health issues. Take the CDC report for the youngest kids (0-4) where there's been a total of 245 deaths with covid over the two years since the pandemic began in the US. Contrast that with 347 deaths in the same age group for the flu season of 2019-2020. And contrast that with the fact that over 600 kids age 1-4 die in America every year from drowning. Kids have been far less likely to die from covid than from a range of other causes up until now, and they seem to spread the virus just as much – whether they're vaccinated or not (at this stage in the pandemic). Those are reasonable factors to consider when trying to answer the original question here of whether to vaccinate your kids or not! Anyway, that's essentially a digression. What fascinates me the most is that Denmark is able to have this sober public debate at all while America largely can't. That the people there who advocate for vaccinating kids have the capacity to not just tolerate but respect those who advocate against it. Maybe that's part of the reason that the Danish health authorities generally enjoy such high trust! Tolerating dissent and discussion is a sign of strength, not weakness. I know this debate isn't squarely one between the US and Denmark. Plenty of other European countries are taking far less lenient stances towards the question than does Denmark. Talk of forced vaccinations in Austria, for example. But these are the two countries I'm spending the majority of my time in, and the contrast is illuminating. How we conduct the public debate is not a given! I just wished the American left in particular would take some inspiration from what is in most other ways a role model for a modern, socially democratic state. If Denmark can have a reasonable debate on a highly contentious topic like whether to vaccinate your kids or not, why can't America?", "date": "2022-01-01T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

But it's less obvious to some how that's possible, given the apparent lack of affordances to tie todos, messages, or check-ins together with code commits automatically. Some teams who are Basecamp curious can't seem get over this conceptual hump: How can we organize the programming work, if everything isn't tied together? The simple answer is: don't. You don't need to string every todo to every commit. Micromanaging that level of detail has the appeal of superficial neatness, but without much if any payoff in additional ease or insight in practical terms. Modern programming projects are already packaged for easy reference and review through the magic of the pull request. That's all the pointer you need. The vast majority of all feature development at Basecamp has a 1-1 relationship between a project and a pull request. This relationship provides all the tie-in necessary to match the work with the planning, at a coarse level that doesn't rely on micro linking every individual piece together. (I'll write another post about why I don't fancy breaking up the work into multiple small pull requests per project.) The entire story is told in two parts: The Basecamp project that sets the scope, manages the outstanding work, documents the trade-offs and the considerations. The GitHub repository that holds the code, the per-line review notes, and the results of continuous integration testing. Let's take the Out of Office feature we just launched for Basecamp. We ran the project in Basecamp as Cycle 6: BC4 Out of Office, and did the nitty-gritty design of How Should It Work in a series of todo threads, like this: The entire feature was tracked as three major todo lists: A list for the epicenter (we could just have shipped this alone), a list for the stretch version (we ended up doing this as well), and a list for the integration with the mobile apps. The progress story was told through a simple hill chart plotting these three scopes moving over the hill: Along side this work of the work, we also used the Basecamp project to have discussions about leaving the campsite better than we found it. Could we move our avatar code in Basecamp to use Active Storage, a recent framework added to Rails? Occasionally we'd settle quick questions via Campfire that needn't be presented as a big argument: Then in the GitHub repository, we'd do code reviews, and handle the discussion of the implementation there: And as you can see on this chop of the commits happening on the repository, none of these commits would have brought additional clarity to the project by being tied to a specific todo or update. And, if one commit really did stand out as being worthy of such a tie-in, you'd just copy and paste the URL to make the connection. Programmers are trained in consistency and coherence. They're key properties of writing good code. But sometimes chasing those properties outside the code just don't offset the cost of doing so. Managing projects, be they code or otherwise, is mostly about communication. Making decisions about how things should work, doing the trade-offs to ship within the time allotted. That's the kind of work that benefits from narratives, selective highlighting, and human context far more than it does from some procedural idea of Tying It All Together. I get that this might feel somewhat alien if you're working at a feature factory pulling tickets from a Jira backlog. That's a very different environment to the one we're cultivating at Basecamp through Shape Up. And as long as you're stuck in that assembly-line mindset, I do think Basecamp probably does seem incompatible. But that's why we're so keen to share the fully integrated story about how we work. From REWORK to It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work to Ruby on Rails to Shape Up to managing all of it in Basecamp.

At-work encryption, as we call it on the HEY security page. But it's on the front end things have made a quantum leap. We've integrated the Hotwire frameworks of Stimulus and Turbo directly as the new defaults, together with that hot newness of import maps, which means you no longer need to run the whole JavaScript ecosystem enchilada in your Ruby app. Turbo traces its roots back to 2012 with the first release of its predecessor Turbolinks. And Stimulus saw its origin in a Christmas spike I did almost exactly five years ago in frustration over the many different ways we were doing JavaScript sprinkles in Basecamp at the time. It's this work that's now finally ready for the big stage of being Rails defaults. The part that really excites me about this version, though, is how much closer it brings us to the ideal of The One Person Framework. A toolkit so powerful that it allows a single individual to create modern applications upon which they might build a competitive business. The way it used to be. There's so much to learn these days, if you want to be an expert in all the latest tools and techniques. The conventional path, as paved by solutions extracted from giant tech companies, is a journey akin to The Oregon Trail. You might well die of dysentery before you ever get to your destination! Rails 7 seeks to be the wormhole that folds the time-learning-shipping-continuum, and allows you to travel grand distances without knowing all the physics of interstellar travel. Giving the individual rebel a fighting chance against The Empire. You simply can't play by the same rules against an opponent exponentially stronger than you. The key engine powering this assault is conceptual compression. Like a video codec that throws away irrelevant details such that you might download the film in real-time rather than buffer for an hour. I dedicated an entire RailsConf keynote to the idea. Will it succeed? Who knows. There are so many vested interests in the subdivision of expertise now. Specialisms are getting ever more narrow. And this is trying to go in the opposite direction. But if there ever was an opening, ever was a chance that we might at least tilt the direction of the industry, now is it. What a glorious time to be working in web development.

They wanted to produce a perfect society by an endless continuation of something that had only been valuable because it was temporary. The wider course would be to say that there are certain lines along which humanity must move, the grand strategy is mapped out, but detailed prophecy is not our business. Knowing what you really want is really hard! It's much easier to settle for knowing what you don't want. So let's not even try to imagine what utopia will emerge once we've gotten rid of all the greed, injustice, and phobias that exist in the world. Instead, let's just trust that it will. As we've seen since, first in the late 60s, then more recently, I don't think continuing to bet on that with blind trust is panning out all that well. James Lindsey traces this speculative, or gnostic, faith in a grand utopia through all these points back to the German philosopher Hegel in the [\"Hegel, Wokeness, and the Dialectical Faith of Leftism\" episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf4R0gX7g3w)of his podcast New Discourses. The crystallization of which also centers on the 60s. With the Frankfurt School, and Herbert Marcuse in particular. Marcuse too embraces this idea that the destination for the radical project is unknowable. That we have to trust that it'll emerge, spontaneously, and, like Orwell prescribes, shouldn't sweat too much about what it might look like. Because of course it's going to be great. Does that sound a little like The Unlimited Potential of Man, as Thomas Sowell presents the unconstrained vision in [A Conflict of Visions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Conflict_of_Visions)? Yes, of course it does. It also lends more than a little credibility to the idea that Sowell's constrained vision – that humans are bound to suffer from greed, inflict injustice, and habor phobias – has something important to teach us. That we won't find a solution – a utopia! – but only trade-offs. As a long-term unconstrained champion, seeking \"solutions\" of all sorts in the realms of technology and company culture, it's been striking to put all these pieces together, and expand my worldview as a consequence. If you too have had an easier time imagining hell from heaven, there's much to contemplate in all these accounts. And plenty of hard questions to wrestle with on how start managing the trade-offs once we've given up on finding The Solution.", "date": "2021-12-13T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

It starts out by debunking the common myth that prior to coinage, everyone were trapped in this inefficient mode of barter. If you had a chicken to give and wanted sugar from Gandalf, but Gandalf was a vegetarian, you had to first trade your chicken to Frodo, who’d give you the barley, that Gandalf wanted for his sugar. This is how most economists from Adam Smith forward have described what they imagined the primitive, inefficient barter economies prior to the advent of coinage looked like. It’s a great sales pitch for modern commerce, but unfortunately, as Graeber details, it’s also mostly made-up bullshit. Communities prior to the advent of coinage didn’t seek to settle their trades on the spot, at least not within those communities. They relied on much more egalitarian long-running concepts of reciprocity. Forms much closer to the communist slogans of “from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs” than the quid pro quo paradigm we all take for granted in today’s market-based societies. The problem, as seen with modern eyes, with early, pre-money egalitarian societies was in part that they didn’t scale. They relied on community bonds to enforce a collective sense of what was good for the group as a whole, backed by the effective corrective measures of family obligations and honor. (Getting ostracized was always there in the background.) Such a social structure is much easier to maintain at the level of a tribe than at the level of city or nation states. But why? Largely because of the freeloader problem. The fear that if we don’t feel like we have direct family bonds that tie our shared faith together in pursuit of a common good, society is going to fill up with moochers and leeches. Those who exploit others to do all the hard work, while they enjoy the fruits of that labor. That fear remains central to modern societies. Witness the evergreen political appeal of pointing out the excesses of welfare kings and queens, or the danger posed by immigration. This is a fear rooted in freeloader fear, which in turn is based on the notion of scarce resources in need of protection. That there’s just not enough to go around! That the party is full. And humankind does have some reasonable historical scars that have kept it from forgetting the Malthusian spectre. This idea that there really is just a hard limit for how many people a given society can support, before it runs out of resources and everyone suffers. These scars were formed by millennia of virtually non-existent productivity growth, which kept the human race in check by the constraints of not enough food, and thus constantly being liable to famines, plagues, and other consequences of lives lived at the threshold of subsistence. Against this backdrop of history, it’s not surprising that the paradigm of scarcity and the fear of freeloaders is deeply embedded in the human psyche. And that it colors most forms of interaction and collaboration, even when doing so is more of an outdated stain than anything. When I was getting into the industry in the mid-to-late 90s, it seemed like we were witnessing the peak of an epic battle between proprietary and free software. This war was embodied at the proprietary end of the spectrum by Bill Gates and Microsoft. The ultimate proprietary extractors, dominators, and conquerors. And at the free-software end of the spectrum, by Richard Stallman and Free Software Foundation. The ultimate software freedom fighters. And there’s no doubt that these two men were diametrically opposed on many of the key questions about how software should be made and distributed. But that stark contrast also had a tendency to overshadow the way in which they were strikingly similar. Both Gates and Stallman built their life’s work on the back of copyright law. One with the right to extract gobs of money from his proprietary software monopoly. The other with the right to extract contributions and distribution concessions from users of his open source software. These rights are founded in a libertarian ideal of ultimate personal freedom backed by strong property rights, enforced by a state apparatus through contracts and courts. The fact that these arch enemies should share some common ideological base really shouldn’t be that much of a surprise. They were both American men born in the 1950s who attended Ivy League universities, came of age during the oil crisis, and were around for the birth of personal computing. That’s a lot of shared societal forces and context exerted on both with ties to the concept of scarcity. You might find this comparison a stretch (or even offensive), and I’m sympathetic to the challenge. I don’t mean to equate the two men’s contributions to software, or those of the organizations they led, in terms of virtue or vice. In fact, for the purpose of this discussion, I don’t even think it’s a terribly interesting topic. What I do think is interesting is how both Gates and Stallman anchored their worldview in a scarcity paradigm that embraced a similar fear of the freeloader problem, and relied on software licenses, that is contracts, to counter it. Gates was afraid that users would take his software and not pay him for it. Stallman was afraid that users would extend his software and not hand over their contributions. Both men believed that the distribution of software was a trade exchange. One that had to be bound by certain explicit debt obligations, which had to be settled or else! Neither Gates nor Stallman were unique in their zeal to control the terms under which their software was used and distributed. Most of the software world fall in the same category. Share the same mistrust of users, and consider some level of debt obligations for using software completely natural. In fact, when I’m wearing my capitalist cape as the co-owner of the software company Basecamp, I too fall into this category! But when I’m wearing my Rails conductor’s cap, it’s a different story. Then the whole premise of strong property rights and debt obligations starts looking awfully screwy. Look at the way we talk about the freeloader problem in general in the open source world. We commonly reach for the tragedy of the commons to explain why licenses, contracts, and a sense of explicit debt obligations are necessary. The tragedy of the commons tells us that individual users will act independently to seek their own maximum self-interest, so if there’s nothing to rein in their native drives, we’re bound to end up with a barren pasture as people just take, take, take, and nobody feels obliged to give. I believe this is a complete conceptual misappropriation for open-source software development. One that has done great harm to our understanding of what we do as open source software writers. The magic of software is that there is virtually no marginal cost! That’s the economic reality that Gates used to build Microsoft’s empire. And what enabled Stallman to “give away” his free software (albeit with strings attached). The freeloaders are free! There is no practical scarcity to worry about. Rails has been downloaded some 170 million times from RubyGems since it started being hosted there. By one account I read, more than a million applications built with Rails have been put online. Neither the first nor the second fact has harmed me in any meaningful way. Not missing the opportunity to collect a tax for each use, like Gates, not missing the opportunity to extract every extension ever made to Rails, like Stallman. If you accept this premise that there is no tragedy of the commons – that open source software cannot be over-grazed by having more people use it – that freeloaders are free, and scarcity is not an applicable concept, then you’re forced to look skeptically at other assumptions we’ve been starting to make lately in the broader open source community. Like the idea that open source software just isn’t “sustainable”. That unless we somehow find a new way to force users to “give back” (i.e. pay/donate!), we’re going to burn out people who donate their “free labor”, but won’t do so forever. In essence, that we’re at the cusp of a Malthusian-Randesque crisis! Too many takers, too few and too poorly compensated makers! Never mind the fact that actual, observed famines are so rare that everyone keeps using the same example when it comes to this debate: OpenSSL! A famine that was promptly alleviated as soon as its effects were apparent. (This is unlike Thomas Malthus who at least had a few millennia of actual, devastating famines to point to.) The problem with the “free labor” perspective within open source is that it narrowly defines creation and collaboration on the same marketplace terms as proprietary software. That this is an exchange of goods and services. That by choosing to use a certain open source package, you’re actually accruing real debt to the makers of this software, which you’re really obliged to settle at regular intervals. Either through one-off monetary donations or continuously paid subscriptions. And even more so, in the vein of an Oracle licensing agreement, your contribution is supposed to scale with your usage or benefit. Like a per-CPU pricing scheme. The bigger the business, the bigger the bill. But isn’t it ironic that same reality of zero-marginal costs – the foundation of these incredibly profitable commercial software empires – is the same one that allows us to reject the market-based framing of collaboration altogether! I’m not saying that there’s something categorically wrong with developing open source on market-based terms. What I’m saying is that it isn’t a necessary condition of sustainability. That there are large, successful projects, like Ruby on Rails, that have thrived on rejecting the market-based approach, and is showing no signs of an impending Malthusian doom. On the contrary. When I look at the literally billions of dollars in business that’s been done on the basis of this thing I started, I don’t look at that with envy or an open mouth. I don’t think “I should have had some of that”. I think what a wonderful world! I have put something into this world, and continue to put my life into that something, which has benefited a tremendous amount of people. And yes, created a tremendous amount of business. From a grateful twenty-billion dollar business of Shopify to a, let’s say, less grateful twenty-billion dollar business of Twitter. If my outlook on my work with Rails had been infected by the aggrieved notion of “free labor”, both of those would look like failures. Like freeloaders who got away with it without paying their dues, just because no money changed hands. Now, if I had this outlook, maybe I’d cut Shopify some slack because of the contributions they have gracefully given back to the community, and continue to do so. But I would certainly look with contempt and anger at Twitter. Not only did Twitter never contribute any material contributions back to the framework, the company ran for cover under the consequences of their own poor architectural decisions in a narrative that blamed Rails for their troubles. What an ungrateful bunch! What an injustice! Or… whatever? If I was a Christian, I’d say turn the other cheek. And as an aspiring stoic, I think of Aurelius’ admonishment that “It doesn’t hurt me unless I interpret its happening as harmful to me. I can choose not to”. Neither Shopify nor Twitter, nor any other company or person, holds the power to cause tragedy to our commons in Rails. There is no tragedy, there will be no tragedy. Rails is a celebration of a utopian commons. A land where honey and milk spring eternal, or at least unrelated to how many people are tapping in. Again, I’m not saying this is a universal truth, but I am saying that it’s a possible truth. An experienced and enduring truth for the work and the community that has been happening around Rails. It’s worth noting that this utopian paradise, where the tragedy of the commons bear no influence on our work, does require a bit of mental self-defense or at least ringfencing. It’s relatively easy to deal with the distanced ingratitude of a Twitter. As I mentioned, I wasn’t looking for any gratitude in the first place! And nobody from Twitter overtly showed up to demand that I fix their problems. Or to apologize for the fact that I hadn’t or wouldn’t. It’s a little different when people actually do! Which they do! Or at least did. It’s not as common as it once was, even if I still see it all the time. But here’s how that mental self-defense looked like in the early days: ![](https://gopher.hey.com/1280x944,q85,sRBz1FDdXx41fzS-k-B1dWrTysV5Wf-Xrk0nz5LK3Ayo=/https://i0.wp.com/m.signalvnoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image.png?resize=640%2C472&ssl;=1) Back in 2005, this is what the v1 firewall looked like to protect myself against vendoritis. That if I was to release others from being indebted to me for using Rails, I surely had to be released from others expecting me to be indebted to them for using Rails. You might think that latter release is obvious, but the marketplace norms are hard to escape. They seep into our unconsciousness. There are plenty of open source users who think themselves less as a recipient of a gift and more like customers with warranty claims. That they’ve done the makers of said open source software a great honor by merely choosing to use their thing. In fact, it’s kinda a natural extension of a society that worships consumerism above little less. A natural extension of “the customer is always right”. Of the adversarial relationship between buyer and seller. And a lot of open source communities actively entice this sort of thinking and behavior. They’re so over-the-top grateful for attention and adoption that they put themselves in this subservient position. “Hey, whatever you gotta do to make the sale, right?” No. Let there be no sale. I accept how that might seem a little strange coming from me of all people. I used all sorts of commercial marketing tricks in the early days of Rails. There was selling going on, there’s no doubt about that. But it wasn’t really for a commercial purpose, but rather, dare I say it, an ideological one. Perhaps a more accurate term would have been proselytizing. I was engaged in the promotion of an ideology, a paradigm, and even a worldview. That might seem like a subtle distinction, and it probably is. But I’m still somewhat regretful that this approach led others down the commercial track, without that distinction in place, and to this questionable end. Today much of open source is “sold” on these marketplace terms. Everything is slick. There’s your video, there’s your cool marketing site, of course you have a sweet logo. It’s often more than a little hard to see the difference between an open source software package and a commercial one. I used to think that this was unequivocally a win for open source. That to fight for attention with the commercial alternatives, we had to adopt the commercial playbook. Now I think it’s at the very least a mixed blessing. That if you dress up like a salesman, it’s a little disingenuous to be surprised when people think they’re buying a product. One way to start swinging the pendulum back towards the days before the commercialization of open source – and I don’t mean that in the sense of Red Hat or whatever, but in the sense of open source thinking it had to out-sell the salesmen – is to look at our founding documents. [This is the MIT license in full](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rails/rails/master/MIT-LICENSE), as it was conceived thirty years ago. Twenty lines of light legalese, of which just six deliver the radical punch: Do what you want, do as you please (just don’t sue). The MIT license is often just lumped in with other open source licenses because of its compatibility with the likes of GPL or other copyleft licenses. That makes it seem like they’re just really flavors of the same thing, but they’re not. In many ways, I consider the MIT license to be as different from copyleft licenses like the GPL as it is from commercial proprietary software. The MIT license to a large extent is the anti-license. The utopia of socialized programs, one that embraces the lack of marginal cost for software goods. It’s an explicit rejection of the strong-property rights approach taken by both Gates and Stallman at their respective ends of the libertarian spectrum. It’s the language of giving without expecting anything in return. It’s the language of sincere charity. A charity without strings attached, neither commercial nor reciprocal. With the risk of sounding sanctimonious, I read it as a pure projection of altruism. It’s kinda funny to analyze the MIT license from this perspective, because I do remember feeling the pull of a primordial debt to the software community when I started Rails. A motion to give back now that I had something to give. I was born into the software community through the grace of open source, and now I had the opportunity to participate as a contributor, and it felt wonderful. But it felt like that exactly because there was no sword hanging over my head. Nobody telling me that this is what I ought or had to do. No one expecting me to do it. So it was an act of volition rather than one of duty. A truly authentic choice. That to me is freedom. The freedom to first pursue self-actualization in making something in my image. The best I possibly knew how. Again, not as free labor, but as a literal labor of love. As an amateur in the original sense of the word. Something that in all honesty has been worth far more than money (or reciprocal gestures) to me. And I say that with the clarity of my privilege, but also from having been on either side of that money while working on Rails! When I started working on Rails in 2003, Jason, my then boss, now business partner at Basecamp, was paying me $25/hour. (In itself a princely sum, up from the $15/hour I was getting paid when we started working together in 2001). I was attending the Copenhagen Business School. I did not have rich parents supporting me, though I did have the backing of a functional welfare state that sees the wisdom in educating its young without trapping them in student debt! Anyway, this was my income, and yet I poured a substantial amount of spare time into making Rails. Hours that I did not bill Jason for! Talk about free labor! Except it wasn’t an investment to curry favor with an employer. Or as some shrewd career play for the long term. In fact, I didn’t see it as an investment at all. I wasn’t doing it expecting any external rewards or advantages, then or in the future. It simply wasn’t a project underwritten by a market-based worldview. On the self-actualization front, it was about the three components of motivation, as Daniel Pink summarized in his book [Drive](https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/): Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose. Autonomy to engage with the challenges that I deemed interesting. In the order that pleased me. In a style that appealed to me. Mastery as a pursuit for its own sake.

In our age, and a stage the size of Rogan's, that feels quaint. Where are the fast jabs? The quick dunks? The stupefied facial expression?Such basic curiosity of trying to really understand what someone else might actually think or believe is in low supply these days.

Under the proposition that if we let the wrong people present their bad ideas, they might convince some of the.. right people? That strikes me as a profoundly insecure and pessimistic conception of the listener. Take William Buckley's interview of Eldridge Cleaver, for example. Buckley 'platformed' a member of the Black Panthers, and gave him amble opportunity to present his view on 'the pigs', the revolution, and all sorts of topics that Buckley himself surely considered 'harmful' (to use a modern description). Did he fear that by letting Cleaver speak on his program that these ideas would infect his coddled viewers, and thus bring calamity upon his beloved nation? No. He thought they could handle – and benefit! – from hearing what 'the other side' thought.Contrast the faith Buckley showed his viewers with this archetypical analysis of Rogan by Alex Paterson of Media Matters in an interview with The Verge:Since I started reporting on Rogan’s podcast... he hasn't faced any real punishment from Spotify. And I think that's emboldened him to continue pushing hate and lies on his podcast. Rogan has stated numerous times that Spotify has never spoken to him about the hate that he pushes on his podcast or taken any steps to try to curt him from doing so. Joe Rogan has shown really clearly that he will use his podcast to spread conspiracy theories, right-wing lies, and racist rhetoric in order to sort of promote himself. So Rogan's show is 'hate and lies', it's incredible that he hasn't been 'punished' for it, and it's all just self-promotion anyway. Okay? Or could it be that the opinions expressed by Rogan or his guests are sincerely held, shared with listeners who needn't be protected from them, and the popularity that have followed is in part a function of this? That seems to be the key problem. The popularity. Why do people keep tuning into this man and his broad array of guests?! Why isn't someone in charge preventing this dissemination of ideas and opinions from happening! Perhaps if our current popular media culture had more Magees and more Buckleys, Rogan's show wouldn't stand out as the throwback beacon that it is. In the mean time, we should celebrate the fact that Rogan's show is as popular as it is. Where else would you hear from both Bernie Sanders and Ben Shapiro. From Michael Pollan and Michael Shellenberger. From Jewel and Snoop Dog. Then we should counter this quest for 'punishment' that might deter other media outlets or personalities from engaging beyond their ideological dome. Finally, we should give viewers, listeners, and readers the same kind of respect that both Magee, Buckley, and Rogan have given theirs: confidence that they can listen to ideas across a spectrum and form their own opinions.", "date": "2021-12-10T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

So many societal seams are unraveling simultaneously. So few ideas for how to stitch those seams back together find common cause. No wonder despair and anger comes so easy to so many right now. These dark emotions are then propelled by the particle accelerator that is Twitter into super-charged takes. All that energy has definitively nuked any previous utopian hope that 'connecting the world' would lead to peace, love, and understanding. That, ironically, is perhaps the one thing everyone does seem to agree on at the moment: social media is making everything political worse. But of course such a conclusion is only shared until the question of who to blame emerges or what to do about it is brought up, and then it's back to the tribal drums. The best shelter I've found from this bombardment has been books. Especially books that bring insights from 'the other side' of my natural political stance. After spending years reading Piketty, Hickel, Graeber, and other left-leaning writers carrying left-leaning messages – who all affirmed and expanded my understanding of taxation, international trade, ecologies, and social systems – I've gained tremendously from some divergent perspectives. What's great about reading books instead of Twitter threads is how they allow the counter arguments room to complete. Over the course of a couple of hundred pages, you'll usually find enough common ground that your mind opens to fairly consider the turf where you might disagree. Take climate change, for example. If you read 'The Uninhabitable Earth' by Wallace-Wells or Hickel's 'Less Is More' in isolation (two books I've highly recommended!), you'll almost certainly come away in both a state of panic and with a passion of #degrowth. They both build very persuasive narratives. But your understanding will deepen immensely if you compliment such books with the likes of 'Apocalypse Never' by Shellenberger. Not because you'll be convinced that climate change isn't a serious, urgent problem (it so very much is!), but because you'll be better prepared for a discussion of what to do about it. Like the critical examination of, say, whether closing all the nuclear plants in Germany in favor of almost exclusively focusing investments in wind and sun was a good idea (Shellenberger makes a very convincing argument that it was not). And hearing out the arguments in long form is so much more satisfying and illuminating than what I could imagine a Shellenberger v Hickel screaming match on Twitter would be like. Because Twitter turns even the best minds into bile when pitted against each other inside the thunderdome. This – reading two books on the same topic from opposing sides – is perhaps the best dialectic we can hope for at this moment. A discourse between two people holding divergent views, expressed on either side in long form, leaving the reader with a chance to derive if not The Truth, then at least better insights. Without the mud and emotion of social-media combat or cable TV stage fights. As weird as it may sound, though, climate change is probably the least dangerous of the present-day hot topics in the US to illustrate this point. That's not because there isn't furious debate over how to tackle climate change, but because so many other contemporary topics in America are so much further inflamed. This extreme tension makes it extremely precarious for civilians to venture beyond the tribal boundaries. Heads are chopped on the daily of people who inadvertently cross the often invisible and always shifting borders of ideological domains. All the more reason exploring heretical ideas from books is the safer path, lest you should be tempted to like or retweet the wrong take to your social detriment. In fact, that self-preserving hesitance against crossing the barbed wires dividing the big American political camps is why I didn't do a traditional recap of which books I had read in 2020. A tradition I'd otherwise kept for four years running. Was it really worth the risk recommending a provocative book right now, went the worry. But as we close 2021, I've come to the conclusion that one of the best hopes for stitching those unraveled societal seams back together is to plant some divergent intellectual seeds on all sides. Grow some appreciation for the counter arguments, disarm some of the knee-jerk reactions that opposing views mean opposing humanities. If my natural sphere of influence had been amongst those leaning to the right on the political spectrum, I would have done a reading list with the likes of Piketty, Hickel, and Graeber. But I suspect that there are more on the left-leaning side of spectrum, so here's a list of recommendations that'll challenge some dearly-held orthodoxies there. A Conflict of Visions: Ideological Origins Of Political Struggles Like Facing Reality, which I'll get to in a moment, I was introduced to Thomas Sowell's signature work on The Glenn Show by Glenn Loury and John McWhorter in discussion with Sowell biographer Jason Riley. The book describes the centuries long history of two grand opposing visions: The Constrained versus The Unconstrained. Which pits the belief that humans are fundamentally constrained by faulty thinking, limited perspective, and imperfect foresight against the belief that there's no limit to the human potential to overcome these challenges. It identifies in these core orientations many of the shared root causes behind most fierce political disagreements that have played out over the centuries. Like who is better equipped to make decisions? Individuals with their unarticulated senses of what's best for them and theirs, or an enlightened few on everyone's behalf? Once Sowell introduces this fundamental dichotomy, it's hard not to identify issues after issues as fitting its analysis. It's a real OHHHH moment. And while Sowell himself is clearly a man of the constrained vision, he does a remarkable job presenting the iron-man argument for the unconstrained side. And is generous with the examples of where the constrained vision has fallen short as well. The book was originally published in 1987, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more decisive inquiry into what motivates political conflicts 35 years later. The Coddling of the American Mind As Sowell covered in Conflicting Visions, the fundamental dichotomy underpinning most political disputes is centuries old. Then why does it suddenly feel like things have gotten so much worse? One argument that carried considered weight for plenty of Americans from 2016-2020 was Trump. That this unique, singular evil that was the primary source of division and animosity. While he definitely accelerated certain trends, the general thesis of Trump as the root cause has been mortally wounded by the year since he left office (and was kicked off Twitter!). This clearly wasn't all down to one man. In this book, Haidt explores the how some of the change instead came from American universities, and the students that started behaving in novel ways around 2012-2013 to free speech, controversial ideas, and ideological thought crimes. I first read Haidt in his excellent book The Righteous Mind from 2012, which presents his research into moral foundations theory. His new book seems in many ways as the applied form of that earlier work. Take the exposition of the redefinition of 'safety'. How 'harm' expanded from physical threats or altercations to include speech and ideas in general. Which then served as the ultimate cover to shutting down said speech and violently opposing said ideas. The book offers a range of explanations as to why American universities saw such dramatic turns, including sheltered upbringing, the advent of mobile phones at the same time as social networks took off, and other factors. The anecdotes from the university episodes he covers are wild. I had to look up a few of them just to feel confident he wasn't exaggerating. But if anything, things have gotten wilder still since this book was published in 2018. The Courage To Be Disliked Together with 'harm', the other popular redefinition of today is 'trauma'. And that's where this Japanese rendition of Alfred Adler's psychology insights slots in perfectly. It's presented as a series of discussions between a student and a master, and while the format is occasionally a bit straining, the ultimate lessons are incredibly timely. Even if Adler has been dead for over 80 years! The basic premise is in some ways similar to Adler's contemporary, and much more well-known colleague, Sigmund Freud. That our conscious actions are driven by our subconscious goals. And that we have to undercover what those subconscious goals are, before we can make sense of and change our actions. But unlike Freud, Adler does not focus on the excavation of past trauma. In fact, he flatly refuses to give the concept credit! He posits that we are indeed free to be happy, right now, if we change our mind for it. To say those thoughts are provocative today would be an understatement. Yet they merely highlight the lessons of the Stoics: That we are only harmed by slights, adversities, and tragedies if we let ourselves be. That two people suffering the same faith can walk away with entirely different perceptions of what happened. And Adler foreshadowed the extentialists as well, like Sartre and Camus. The idea of radical freedom, and the at time insufferable weight of that freedom. We want to believe we HAVE to do or are FORCED to feel certain things. But we're not. Adler's psychological insights presented in this book are such a reminder that the mental struggles we wrestle with today aren't novel at all. They might wax and wane across time, but much of trouble with the human condition is a timeless challenge. And we'd do well to listen to those who examined the problem of existence hundreds or even thousands of years before us. Woke Racism John McWhorter has catapulted himself to the limelight as of late. He recently got a regular column in The New York Times. He's been getting featured on shows like Real Time with Bill Maher. All for very good reason: he's brilliant. In this, his latest book, McWorther presents one of the most eloquent and persuasive counters to what he deems The New Religion (i.e. Wokeness/The Elect). And in it summarizes a couple of years of opposition to this new religion, as developed in his public conversations with Glenn Loury, in his earlier substack, and elsewhere. This book made several things click for me in a way they hadn't before. Like how the political goals of 'wokeness' seem at such odds with the tactics of constant denunciation, shaming, inscrutable vocabulary, and utter contempt for anyone who aren't up on the latest advances in its theology. Because it is less of a political movement, intent on building a broad coalition, for specific social advances, and more of a religion seeking to elevate a small pious congregation towards a second coming of a 'antiracist' humanity. Great counter for anyone who've read White Fragility (paired well with Matt Taibi's review of that book). By an eminent black intellectual dissecting the arguments from a center-left stance that takes the outmost care not to vilify his opponents. San Fransicko The religious theme from Woke Racism can with great advantage be carried over to the debate about homelessness in America. Shellenberger (yes, the same author as wrote Apocalypse Never) pins this comparison by explaining the terrible spiral of degradation that's happening in the 'open-air drug markets' in cities like San Francisco (Tenderloin), Los Angeles (Skid Row), and Seattle (Blade). He calls it the sacralization of victims. This sacralization prevents any meaningful intervention that has proven itself to work elsewhere, like in The Netherlands and Portugal. Drug addicts can't be mandated treatment, because 'they have to want to get clean', and seriously mentally-ill people can't be treated in suitable mental institutions, because involuntary commitment of dangerous people is a violation of their rights as victims. Meanwhile, an unrealistic and long-failing Housing-First policy is pursued to the detriment of offering immediate shelter. So thousands sleep on the street in tent encampments and on the side walk. With all the human feces, trash, and needles that come with that. Partly because 'homeless' is presented as one category, covering the majority of homeless people in the aforementioned cities that are either addicted to drugs or seriously mentally ill, together with people who've ended on the street solely for economic reasons. The consequence is an ever-deteriorating set of progressively-controlled cities that keep throwing more and more money after solutions that have proven themselves not to work. And in the process rendered parts of those cities, but none more so than San Francisco, seriously uninhabitable. While the book is predominately dedicated to the homelessness issue, it also addresses the general problem of escalating crime as a consequence of new progressive prosecutors who also 'center' the 'victims'. Shellenberger couldn't be more timely with this tome. San Francisco looks like a city under siege in several areas today. The progressive gaslighting that burglaries and car break-ins are 'just things' and to be expected is reaching all time highs. Again, like Taibbi, this critique of San Francisco is so piercing because it comes from a center-left perspective. This isn't some twirly-mustached cartoon of a Law & Order Capitalist. Facing Reality Where San Fransicko points to a decades-long history of trying to solve a set of social problems in progressive cities without success, Charles Murray tackles an even broader set of questions around solving problems of race, education, achievement, and violence nationwide on at least as long of a timescale. It's a short book, but perhaps the most explosive of all on the list. So I'd just invite you to checkout Murray's interviews with Glenn Loury or Coleman Hughes to see if that's something you'd want to dive into. Hate Inc But why is it actually that we have to seek shelter in books to get a proper exposition of two sides of an argument today? Isn't that supposed to be the meat of what the media delivers? Well, maybe it was at some point, in some idyllic age before this. A time when the stabilizing force of 'having to appeal broadly for maximum distribution' was an economic necessity for ad-funded media. That is not our reality today. Today much of popular media has found its respite from the relentless assault on revenues delivered by Google and Facebook in appealing to a single, ideological demographic. And that's what Taibbi's excellent book covers. This tack might have been originally pioneered in modern American times by Fox News, but their success has quickly been adopted across the board. Most obvious on the other side in cable news by MSNBC and CNN, but even the newspaper of record has fallen prey to this dynamic (something like 95% of New York Times' subscribers self-identify as democrats!). The consequence is that to get a complete picture of the news, you need to read across the divide. Rarely because the ideological coverage is directly wrong (although that happens enough too), but mostly because it's a filter on what is allowed to be covered. Taibbi cites Chomsky's classic Manufacturing Consent with the modern twist that so much of the media is now in the business of Manufacturing Discontent. Because telling people what they want to hear is better business once you've given up on appealing broadly. A thoroughly enjoyable read. Especially because Taibbi isn't shy to implicate his own former work, but also because he comes at this as a long-term critic of right-wing media, so this critique of the left-wing media is all the more credible. I can also strongly recommend a subscription to Taibbi's Substack for more timely media critique of the same variety. So that's it. Seven books (or eight, if you count Apocalypse Never) that might broaden your horizon, if you come from a left-leaning worldview. You might not like all of them, but I think it's unlikely you won't find yourself more intellectually challenged by these than by reading yet another string of existing-beliefs-reaffirming Twitter threads.", "date": "2021-12-01T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

You don't have to reduce an entire profession to a clueless gang of copy-pasta pirates to make new recruits feel welcome. It undermines the aspiration to improve. It reduces the work to magical thinking. It is not good. I say this an evaluation of the prescription, not of the diagnosis. The programming world absolutely has had, and still has, challenges with imposter syndrome and gatekeeping. In large part because, unlike so many other professional fields, a high percentage of the people working in programming are self-taught. (Including yours truly!). When you don't have a diploma from a prestigious institution telling you and the world that \"you know things, and you're good at things\", it's only natural to occasionally have doubts. Especially if there are people within your profession who use their diplomas as a logical fallacy to prove why they're right and you're wrong. But you can't let that doubt win. You can't become the I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING dog as a professional identity. Don't embrace being a copy-pasta programmer whose chief skill is looking up shit on the internet. Treat it as part of a learning process to actually understand what's going on. Not merely as a shortcut to solve today's problems. If you never dig deeper, your competence will be stuck at the surface. Likewise, influential programmers who do have the hard-earned skills and accumulated knowledge to repeatedly create good software need to resist the temptation of presenting a \"yes, I too am a know- little, copy-pasta dummy, JUST LIKE YOU\" facade. Whatever gains you derive from being relatable to someone struggling must be weighed against infusing this industry with a sense of futility of deep learning. The magic of programming is largely just things you don't know yet. Once you learn those things, it stops being magic in the sense of \"I have no idea how it did that or why it works\" and starts being magic in the sense of \"I can make the computer do exactly what I ask it to do!\". The point is to become the wizard, not the bedazzled member of the audience. This does not happen overnight, and we need to have the confidence to accept that our profession has depth, even as we celebrate the ease with which someone can get started (and welcome them onto the journey of becoming a wizard)! It also doesn't happen across all the domains of programming. You can't become an expert at everything, and it's fine to accept your boundaries. But it's not fine to think you shouldn't be on some paths towards mastery, if you intend to make programming your career. We also need to accept that not all wizard apprentices turn out to be of equal talent or end up with equal levels of competence. Just like in every other field of human pursuits. You can learn the basic rules of chess in a few minutes, but you can also spend a lifetime mastering the game (and not everyone becomes a grand master, even if they try very hard!). The world has never had a greater need for programmers than it does today. It's never had a greater need for competent programmers than it does today. Let's skip the overly self-deprecating nonsense that nobody knows what they're doing, and trying to learn things in depth is not for us. You're not a clueless dog banging at the keyboard with no prospects of ever improving. You're a human of tremendous capacity to become good at what you do. Embrace that.", "date": "2021-11-25T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Both at the managerial level and between coworkers. There's a real fear that staying remote for too long will eventually lead to nobody really knowing what's going on, and thus the organization will drift apart. The dread of that question is often underpinned by an assumption that the solution might be an even more frequent barrage of video calls to replace the stand-ups, management-by-walking-around, and other in-office practices that at least had a human feel to them. And if there's one thing we've learned during this pandemic, it's that even people who like meetings don't like virtual meetings in the same quantity. A few, okay. All of them, all the time? No. But the real answer is simpler than you might imagine. The way to know what people are working on is simply to... ask them! Automatically and all the time. So that's what we do at Basecamp with two key questions: What did you work on today? and What will you be working on this week? We pose these questions using Basecamp's automatic check-ins feature, and make it a norm that people working in development roles answer the daily question at least a few times a week, and that they answer the weekly question every week. It's amazing how much illumination these two questions alone can provide. Distributing a broad sense of what's going on at a company. Part of the benefit here is that reporting progress isn't just a relationship between an employee and their boss, or even an employee and their team. It's available to the whole company! Or at least, that's how it works at Basecamp. If you run a company of many hundreds of people, you'd probably have to split it up somewhat, but while a traditional stand-up meeting might communicate status to a handful of people, these automated questions can easily do so to fifty people or more. That's a fundamental change. In addition to distributing a broad feeling of what's going on in the moment, these questions provide a personal record of what you've been working on over the long term. It's easy to get so caught up in the daily tasks that you forget to zoom out and gauge whether you're actually making progress on that big picture you're intend to paint. I often look back through my own answers at the end of a cycle to help calibrate on that. It also serves as an early warning system when someone is struggling and needs help. If the answers are weak, vague, or vanishing for a long time, it's an invitation to checkin with that person. When someone is stuck, it's often hard to explicitly ask for help, but when their answers make clear that progress isn't happening, it serves as an implicit way of saying the same. Finally, it's an invitation for cross-team pollination. I see all the time someone mention something they're working on, only to have someone from another team respond in a comment that actually they were dealing with the same issue from a different angle, and here's how we can fix it together. Exactly the kind of serendipitous encounters that people new to remote work keep yearning for the physical water cooler for. Asking people what they've worked on and what they intend to work on frequently and automatically gives the company a daily pulse of progress. That goes a long way to counteract the feelings of isolation and separation when working remotely. A force of gravity to oppose the drift that might otherwise set in.", "date": "2021-10-06T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

It has endowed me with a thick skin to repel the haters, and kept me going whatever they said. But after close to two decades of having my work often judged favorably, I’m still no better at dealing with gestures of adoration. In fact, I think it’s gotten worse, as technology has gotten better (or more conniving, if you will) at feeding me a steady drip of likes, hearts, and flattering comments. The line hooks straight into a part of my brain that never thickened up and remains as tender as ever. This recurring burst of endorphins is addictive. And while you can certainly be addicted to worse things than gestures of adoration for a job well done, it’s an addiction nonetheless. One with many of the same side effects as any other addiction. For one, it cultivates dependence through vanity. The intrinsic lure of the work is diminished by the extrinsic reception to the work. Waiting for the crowd to please the work rather than the work to please the mind. This dependency stokes anxiety, and can lead to downright manic behavior. I’ve found that when I publish anything that hits a nerve with the crowd, it’s my own nerves that are pierced by ricochet. I can ruin a perfectly good day by publishing a piece that bites. An endless cycle of refreshing for flattering comments, watching incrementing retweet counters, and seeing the likes stream by. It gets worse as the tolerance builds. If the last thing I published saw so and so much engagement, then anything less on a subsequent piece is at least somewhat a failure. What a perverse bar. I think it’s this ever-increasing tolerance that has ruined many creatives. The more powerful and immediate the gratification of adoration, the more severe the withdrawal from its absence. Just look at actual rockstars. How many of them turn up as insecure wrecks in need of actual drugs to supplement or replace the pleasing of the crowd? The natural high of other people cheering you on is only poorly substituted by packaged chemicals, but at least it’s something to soothe the withdrawal. As with most substances, though, it’s the dose that makes the poison. If you’re not used to having your work judged favorably, the initial high of seeing it so can give a real kick. One that might well provide the motivation to keep going when you were otherwise close to quitting. It’s a boost. That’s not in itself a bad thing. It’s the long-term exposure that does the harm. It’s the building of a tolerance. The cultivation of vanity. It’s not the first hit, but the forty-fifth. It was a week’s worth of abstinence from Twitter and Instagram that brought about this reflection. It felt liberating. Liberating not to play to a crowd with the power to instantly judge the performance. Liberating to be free from the likes, the hearts, and those flattering comments.

Epic's disappointment with the verdict in their trial against Apple. They sought to have the iPhone recognized as the pocket computer it is. One where consumers should have the right to install the applications of their choice, like with any other general-purpose computer, and where developers should be free from extortion, retaliation, and other monopolistic abuse from the platform owner.

Because most of this careful analysis of the injunction misses the big picture: Apple's forced IAP is either dead, a joke, or illegal. Let's start with becoming a joke. Apple's current regime of forcing IAP down developers' throats is entirely contingent on the gag orders that go with it. The rules that say developers can't link to or even tell consumers about other places to buy digital goods and services outside of the App Store, or how much they'd save if they did. That's the so-called anti-steering provisions.Those rules have one of two primary outcomes. It can lead to cryptic, user-hostile welcome screens, like the one for Netflix, where the developer has to try to tell their customers why they can't sign up for the app from the app, but without using certain forbidden words. It's really bizarre, and clear evidence of consumer harm. Or it can lead to disgruntled developers begrudgingly accepting that they can't fight the monopoly beast, and submitting to using IAP against their will. Because what else are they going to do? Apple has them by the purse.Now imagine that Apple abides by the injunction but also attempts to continue forcing IAP upon developers who don't want it. The gag orders are gone, because that was the anti-steering provisions explicitly prohibited by the injunction.

Signup for your own @hey.com email address for $99/year on our website. It only takes a second, and you can use Apple Pay or enter your credit card directly! ... Small print: You can also signup using Apple's IAP for $199/year. It's the same service, except we'll have a harder time giving you proper support, and you won't be able to manage or transfer your subscription to Windows or Android. We'd really rather you didn't, but hey, if you want to pay double such that a monopolist can add another trillion to their market cap, you do you! Maybe Apple will reject that? But on what grounds exactly? And even if this outright snark won't fly, does it matter? What if you simply steer your customers to a primary offering on your own website in large text as the default option, then have the twice-the-price IAP option in small below? The method of offering this doesn't even matter. In-app or external is largely irrelevant with modern UI affordances. You can barely tell the difference between a payment flow that kicks you out to Safari (with that handy back link to the app in the upper left!) or one that happens inside a web view within the app. The web flow can easily redirect you back into the app once the transaction is complete anyway. Apple would also have to tread careful in how they police the steering employed by developers. And they would have a very hard time policing the price differential. One of the biggest no-nos in monopoly land is price fixing. So it would be surprising if Apple dares be overtly explicit about how these offers can be presented, and whether the spread can be greater than 30%. That's the thing about injunctions. The consequence for violating them is contempt of court. It may even be *criminal*contempt of court. Is Tim Cook going to risk a criminal indictment over an attempt to police language and fixing prices? I doubt it. So that's how forced IAP becomes a joke. With developers free to disparage the thing they don't want to offer but are forced to anyway, it'll give channel to all the pent-up frustrations from years of abusive behavior by Apple. As a consequence, the IAP option could quickly become known as the chump option amongst consumers. Paying 30% or more for the same thing, but worse? How many consumers are actually going to do that? What's the brand damage to Apple when they don't? And if Apple tries to fight it, risking contempt of court, they're highly likely to be found again to have committed illegal acts! So do you want to let your forced IAP regime become a joke or do you want to continue your illegal anti-steering measures? Both pretty poor choices, if you ask me. Which leads us to the most likely outcome in my opinion: It's game over for forced IAP. Apple will simply have to accept competition for developers on a (sorta) level playing field with the likes of Stripe, Square, and PayPal. They'll still have all sorts of advantages, given how they can preference their own setup flow, save a credit card system wide, and such, but those advantage will just not be worth the obscene 30% premium they can currently charge in the absence of competition. And that's the point, isn't it? If Apple can't use their dominant market position in mobile operating systems to tie an exorbitantly-priced payment processor to the right to distribute software for that platform, the competitive forces will be unleashed to do what they're supposed to do: Offer better services on better terms at better rates! That's why we need lawmakers, regulators, and judges. Since Adam Smith, it's been broadly recognized that markets can't function like they're supposed to when captured by cartels, duopolies, monopolies, or other dominant market forces. The market performs its magic when it's kept free of capture. Keeping it so requires eternal vigilance. Epic is therefore right to be disappointed that they couldn't strike a more decisive blow against this market capture in their court case, but what they did achieve is still remarkable. The defacto fall of forced IAP would a monumental victory. And the judge's ruling of Apple's anti-competitive actions as illegal under California law, and near-monopoly status under federal statutes, is a big step forward too. I know Epic has already elected to appeal the case, and I hope they do even better with the 9th Circuit, but the injunction is likely to stand regardless of whether Apple tries to do the same, based on careful legal analysis I've been privy to. Which means that in now less than 90 days, developers will most likely have materially more freedoms, while Epic v Apple carries on, and lawmakers push their more fundamental reforms forward.

Let's just say it's a billion dollar a month in profits. Whatever threat to that tollbooth cash stream that can be delayed even just a week is potentially worth*hundreds of millions of dollars*. For a week!The sums involved are just staggering. Yet what's even more staggering is that the App Store is not even Apple's main business!

The iPhone alone is half of that. And off that revenue, they made $57 billion in profits. That's more than a billion dollars in profit per week. So despite their enormous scale, the App Store taxes are probably less than a fifth of Apple's total profits.Which echos [Gruber's point](https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut)that it's astounding Apple let things get this far. Why are they risking the antitrust scrutiny of regulators and lawmakers around the world, as well as setting fire to their relationship with developers, over a minority part of the business?

This change will most likely take effect within a fortnight, and when it does, it'll herald the end of the 30% app-store cut as we know it. Apple and Google will now have to compete for the business of developers on the merits. Such competition is bound to cost Apple and Google billions. Operating these app store tollbooths are some of the most lucrative revenue streams flowing from the Android and iOS duopoly. They require little to no innovation to operate, just dominant market power, which both companies have in excess. Now that power has been countered in South Korea. But as much as South Korea is an important market, particularly for Google, it's not the fifty million people there that truly scare either of these companies. It's the crack in the dam. The one that'll soon flood their scarecrow arguments on app-store payment mandates around the world. South Korea just made it a lot easier for every other country in the world to pass their own laws outlawing anti-competitive app store payment mandates. These countries will be able to point to South Korea to show that allowing developers to use Stripe, Square, Braintree, PayPal, or whatever to charge their customers won't bring about app armageddon. Reality is going to refute the fear that Apple and Google have been working so hard to stoke. This is a watershed moment that'll force Apple and Google to actually have to work for their cut. Yes, of course the cut is going to come down, and probably massively so, but there's still plenty of space for an integrated, low-friction payment solution for developers where they can charge a premium. Only that premium is likely to land somewhere between five and ten percent, not an outrageous thirty! But I wouldn't even assume that Apple or Google is going to have the best solution in the long term! When you look at the innovation going on in payments at the moment, like Stripe's integrated sales-tax solution, it's likely that developers will soon have many excellent app-optimized payment choices to choose from. All competing with better features, better terms, and better rates. And yet now it's done! The first, real, substantial loss inflicting upon this monopoly app store regime that nearly cost our new email service HEY.com its life last year.

The boss is being dazzled with the usual, trite spiel that enterprise sales people lay on middle managers, like 'waste is a thief'. But the caricature's central psychological point is revealed when the boss injects: 'Can I get that icon in cornflower blue?'. It's magnificent. See, that interjection, the request for a meaningless color change of a fucking icon, is an onion of an existential power analysis. You can keep peeling the layers. Let's start at the most obvious: 1) The boss is requesting the change of color because it asserts his justification in the process. This is a discerning business professional who does not just take the first deal that gets sent his way. Oh no, he negotiates. Negotiating what doesn't matter. The whole thing is about proving to himself, and his employer, that he's valuable and important. 2) It's a cynical dance where both parties know that the other side is both acting and full of shit. The boss doesn't actually care about changing the color of some stupid icon to cornflower blue, and the salesman cares even less about complying. But these are the ceremonial steps required by the corporate dance, such that all parties can claim to have discharged their duties. 3) Because the essence of this dance is so nakedly cynical, and reveals the utter pointlessness of the participants' existence (in the David Graeber sense of bullshit jobs), they can't consciously admit to the cynicism. So the boss lets out a smug little side smile instead, and the sales person exaggerates his ritualistic compliance with an overly enthusiastic 'absolutely'. 4) It's not just that the individual participants are performing pointless roles, but that the play itself is pointless, and yet inevitable. Neither the boss nor the salesman has any real power to affect the outcome. The software is going to be bought, it's probably going to suck – or not, who cares! – and everyone around that table is confined to this outcome. 5) The only human response to this exercise of soul-sucking drudgery is to show your teeth soaked in blood. Which is exactly what Edward Norton's character does to conclude the scene. He'd literally rather swallow a pint of blood than to sit through this shit. This new Apple settlement with a group of class-action legal vultures follow the arc of that iconic scene in Fight Club. In which both parties have assumed their ceremonial positions in a pointless settlement that reaffirm existing provisions and then asks for a couple of cornflower blue icons. Let's take it step by step again: 1) The plaintiffs – here being the actual lawyers in the class-action proceeding, not the interests of the developers they supposedly represent – have justified their pursuit for loot mainly by getting Apple to reaffirm existing policies. Like having them affirm that 'at the request of developers, Apple has agreed that its Search results will continue to be based on objective characteristics like downloads, star ratings, ...'. So part of this settlement is that Apple says it'll continue to do search like it's done so far, and that it won't make it worse for users and developers by corrupting it with self-dealings and sold preferences, but only for the next three years? What a concession to extract! It keeps going on like this, such as the pointless concession that pricing can now be $40.99 and $41.99, in addition to the normal $39.99 and $44.99, or any other number out of a predetermined 500 price points instead of the previous 100. Talk about the many hues of cornflower blue. But it gets worse, because the trophy of this settlement, as presented in the press, is supposedly that developers can now tell their customers where to buy services outside the app. Except no, that's not actually what's happening! Apple is simply 'clarifying' that companies can send an email to their customers, if they've gotten permission to do so, on an opt-in basis. That email may include information about how to buy outside the app. So the steering provisions of the App Store, that developers are not allowed to tell users inside their app or on the signup screen about other purchasing choices than IAP – the only places that actually matter! – is being cemented with this 'clarification'. It draws a thicker line, asserts Apple's right to steer in the first place, and offers the meaningless concession of opt-in email, which was something developers had already been doing. 2) The legal vultures running this class-action suit knew that all these clarifications and agreements were cornflower blue requests from the outset. The point of the negotiation was never to extract any meaningful change of policy or behavior, but to provide cover for the process, such that they could claim to have performed their judicial duties to the underlying plaintiffs (developers). While walking away with $30M in fees that they took from an Apple-administered charity provision that's part of the deal. 3) The cynicism of this performance drips in every other sentence of Apple's press release about the matter. Like the aforementioned sentence about how 'At the request of developers, Apple has agreed that its Search results will continue to be based on objective characteristics'. Yes, you can have your search results in cornflower blue. Because they already were! But also, we may change the color in three years. Of course you legal vultures will be long gone by then. You won't care, we don't care, this is all a performance of compliance! 4) Since the entire game was rigged for the outcome of having the class-action vultures taking a third cut of whatever settlement sum is included from the outset, Apple knew this too. Negotiating around the specific but meaningless points of the deal was just a way to justify that final outcome: Apple pays these lawyers $30m, such that they can print a press release that gullible journalists will try to spin as having some larger meaning, because that story travels better. 5) The only human response is to show our blood-soaked teeth in disdain for such a blatantly corrupt deal. Developers have suffered a litany of indignities under Apple's monopoly power over the years, and now they'll suffer a few more. The twist being that they now come from the hands of a group of legal vultures pretending to advocate on developer's behalf but are really just paid to collude with Apple. If the developer community had any hopes riding on this class-action lawsuit, this outcome would have been a dagger in the heart. Far worse than if no suit has been undertaken at all. If anything, this settlement cements the tremendous power that Apple has and wields. Even when a class-action lawsuit gets underway, it can be bought with bromides and bribes.", "date": "2021-08-27T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Through all of the 2000s, I chased different approaches to avoid writing too much of it. First there was RJS (Ruby-to-JavaScript). Then there was CoffeeScript. Both transpiling approaches that turned more enjoyable-to-write source code into the kind of JavaScript that browsers would execute. It sorta worked. But it was clearly a clutch. A stop-gap while we waited for browsers to understand a better JavaScript. Though for a while it looked like that might never happen, and we'd forever be stuck with these clutches! Thankfully that wasn't so. JavaScript It was a revelation. Being able to program using this much better JavaScript, well before broad browser support was available. It kinda felt like cheating. Like we were getting something for nothing. That wasn't quite right, though. Transpiling with Babel ushered in the era of horrendously complicated transpiling pipelines and tooling. Writing the JavaScript of the future wasn't free. The price was an ever expanding web of complexity. This clearly wasn't the finish line. I'm grateful that tools like Webpack made this transition possible, though. Despite the complexity, it felt worth the bargain. So back in 2016, I created Five years later, the facts on the ground have finally changed. I no longer believe that this bargain is worth it for most new applications. It's not a dead-end, and there are still certain types of applications where it does make sense (hello react!), but it's no longer a good default for Rails. The first crucial change is that ES6 is now supported by all browsers that matter. Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox fully support ES6. The last major hold out was IE11, but This means we don't need a transpiling step to turn ES6 into something that'll run in the browser. It runs just fine, no changes needed. That's huge. The second crucial change is that HTTP2 is now the norm. With HTTP2, you no longer pay a large penalty for sending many small files instead of one big file. A single connection can multiplex all the responses you need. No more managing multiple connections, paying for multiple SSL handshakes. This means that bundling all your JavaScript into a single file loses many of its performance benefits (yes, yes, tree-shaking is still one). In fact, the single-big-bundle pattern is now worse in several ways, not just developer ergonomics (like long bundling times!). When you bundle all your JavaScript modules in a single file, any change to any module will expire the entire bundle. Forcing the browser to download the whole thing anew, parsing everything again. That's bad. When you keep each module separate, they can expire independently. So if you have 20 modules, and only one change, the other 19 remain cached. This is the kind of caching dynamics that performance enthusiasts crave. But more importantly for our overall argument is that if you no longer need bundling for performance, you can get rid of the bundler entirely! Simply serve each module directly, as their own file, directly to the browser. Can you see where we're getting to? No need for transpiling to write the kind of JavaScript that makes you smile, no need for bundling to package all your modules. Taken together: No need for any JavaScript toolchain to turn your source code into anything else. An entire class of complexity stands at the precipice. The final piece that's pushing the two first crucial changes over the paradigm hill is import maps. They allow the use of logical references for modules in ES6 (also known as ESM), rather than explicit file references. The problem with explicit file references is that they pair poorly with the standard approach of long-life caches with digest-stamped file names. When you see a filename like main-a6d26cef87d241eba5fa.js, that last bit is a digest of the entire file. It's unique for that specific file, so if we change anything in the file, the digest changes too. This means that we can tell the browser to cache the file with the digest But imagine if you had 50 files that all had an opening import like 'import { Controller } from './javascript/stimulus-a6d26cef87d241eba5fa.js'", "date": "2021-08-12T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

So no more ads for Apple Arcade in your Settings app. No more hijacking all travel searches on Google to funnel travelers through their own booking services. No more cramming default apps that can’t be uninstalled down user’s throat. Remember how we just got the basic ability to set our own mail application on iOS this past summer? Yeah, it’s that, but by law, applied to everything. Your own calendar app, your own messaging app, you own everything. Oh, and all those annoying preinstalled apps you don’t want but the platform keeps pushing anyway now have to be uninstallable! Hurray! No more gag orders on developers. Apple won’t be able to deny developers the right to link to their own damn website. Or tell them where to sign up for a service. Or even tell them that they have a paid service! NO MORE FORCING IN-APP PURCHASING ON DEVELOPERS!! The bill prevents tying the use of other services, like payment processing, to the ability to publish on the platform. All the dreaded language from Apple’s App Store Guidelines with all the weird loopholes and exemptions for who is and isn’t supposed to pay the 30% extortion will be illegal. Developers will have the freedom to publish on the App Store using their own payment processing (or use Apple’s, should they prefer!). Basic protections against discrimination and retaliation. This essentially turns the app stores into common carriers. Which is an established antitrust idea of forcing platform owners to offer the same deal to everyone. Just like Net Neutrality prevents ISPs from shaking down individual websites. This bill will prevent app store platforms from shaking down individual app makers according to their whims. All this is backed up by the potent penalties of up to 15% of the platform owner’s revenue or 30% of injured party’s revenue, whichever is larger. There’s some poetic justice in those rates, as they’re exactly the same as the payment extortion fees demanded by Apple and Google of some app developers. The FTC and the antitrust division’s attorney general are in charge of enforcing general compliance with the law. But injured parties are also eligible to sue directly under the law. Not just for penalties and damages, but also for injunctions. If this law had been on the books last summer, we would never have had to endure those awful two weeks of intimidation and threats from Apple when we launched HEY. Presumably Apple wouldn’t even have tried, because there would have been no 3.1.1, but even if they would have, the case to get an injunction would have been a slam dunk. Didn’t I tell you these bills were bold? If they pass Congress in anywhere near their current forms, we have a veritable revolution on our hands for the digital economy. Powerful protections against big tech abusing their monopoly advantage to shakedown individual developers and entire industries. Strong boundaries to prevent the platforms from expanding their power and marketshare even further through predatory acquisitions. Excellent consumer protections to ensure you can always get your data out, and have the choice to install your preferred default apps for all kinds of services. But the party isn’t over yet! The main enforcer of all these new bills will be the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and guess who just got confirmed as the chair of that commission? LINA KAHN!! You seriously could not wish for a more qualified or determined enforcer of these new laws than her. She’s been instrumental in shaping the modern outlook on antitrust, and moving us beyond that dreaded and outdated “consumer welfare” standard that has allowed big tech to run roughshod over everyone else unopposed. She was a driving force behind the House Antitrust Subcommittee’s series of hearings and the ultimate report on digital markets that directly lead to all these new bill proposals. She’s big tech’s worst nightmare and the dream chair for the rest of us. Sure, you say, but these bills still have to pass Congress before they become law. True, but look at the sponsors for all of these bills. Each and every one of them have sponsors on both the democratic and republican side. Opposition to big tech’s monopoly abuses is one of the very few truly bipartisan issues in Washington these days. I think these bills have an excellent chance to pass exactly because of that. Taken all together, even just this promise of a chance – just one chance! – to strike at the heart of big tech and end their reign of abuse is invigorating. It’s far more than I could ever have hoped for when I showed up in Colorado in January of last year to testify before the House Antitrust Subcommittee. It more than makes up for the disappointment of seeing Apple and their lobbyists kill the democratic attempts at accountability at the state level. And as if all of this wasn’t enough, it’s not like things have been quiet on the eastern front either. In Europe, the German competition authorities, called The Bundeskartellamt, just announced they’re pursuing Apple for violations of the a new January 2021 amendment to the German Competition Act. This act gives more teeth and more bite to investigating and sanctioning monopoly abusers, and Apple is the first target in their sights. At Basecamp, we continue to work with other competition authorities in Europe as well. Just like we’ve done here in the US. Because the power of big tech is not constrained to a single country or territory. It’s a global power that demands a global response. And after more than a decade of slumber on this issue, the leviathans around the globe are finally waking up, and big tech is about to meet the one real obstacle to world domination: Sovereign governments with democratic mandates.

Although upgrading is perhaps a big word. It's not like we rewrote all the JavaScript we have to make this happen. Coexisting is probably a better term. While existing JavaScript code stays as it is, we're now set for all our future development to use Turbo Frames, Turbo Streams, and Stimulus 2.0. Yay! Basecamp 3 was originally built with Rails UJS, Turbolinks, and Stimulus. In our new setup, Rails UJS is still there to handle data-remote/data-method forms and links for the legacy code, but it leaves alone any link or form tagged with data-turbo=true. Making this so required an upgrade to the UJS event handler selectors, which will be part of the next Rails release. And if you are still using rails/jquery-ujs (like Basecamp!), there's a new version 1.2.3 with the updated selectors as well. It also required that all these new forms and method links we want flowing through Turbo instead of Rails UJS be tagged with that data-turbo=true attribute. Something you don't need to do if you're starting with Turbo from the beginning, like we did with HEY, but it's a small price to pay for coexistence. The upgrade to Stimulus 2.0 (from 1.1) took a little more effort, but solely because we wanted to upgrade early to the new target format of data-[identifier]-target=[name] instead of data-target=[identifier].[name] (to get rid of the deprecation warnings). Although it was easy enough, I still managed to wrongly turn a few of these conversions into duplicate data-[identifier]-target attributes. So pay attention to that. The meat of the coexistence work was in replacing Turbolinks with Turbo. Turbo Drive is a direct continuation of Turbolinks, but it still required a fair bit of work to update all the namespaced events, and ensure that the Ajax requests coming from Rails UJS would play nice with 302 redirects. That was something the old turbolinks-rails gem included in the box, but turbo-rails does not (since it's not needed for greenfield work). There was enough steps in that process to warrant documenting them in the turbo-rails repository. As part of this work, I caught up with both the Turbo and Stimulus repositories. I released a couple of new versions of Turbo/Turbo Rails, which both fixed a number of bugs, but also gave us some great new powers, like before/after actions, built-in method links, and deduping of existing elements on the append/prepend actions. We're up to beta 7 now, and will keep going on the beta process for a bit longer while clearing out the backlog of pull requests and issues, but then it'll soon be time for a proper 7.0 final release as well. Stimulus is also due for a 2.1 release in the near future, which will include a helpful debug mode, previous value passing on the ValueChanged callbacks, default values, and a few other overdue enhancements. This kind of upgrade work is something it's so easy to put off for existing applications. What you have already works, right? But if you keep doing that forever, you eventually end up with a codebase that's so far from the state of the art that it won't be any fun to work in it. It's not that you have to rewrite everything from scratch all the time, but taking the effort to ensure that new code can be written to the best of your abilities is key to enjoying the work. And as you extend existing features, follow the principle of leaving the campsite better than you found it. For Basecamp, that means rewriting any of that old jquery code when we're doing substantial work around features using it. As the baboon said: 'It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier.

I could have yelled and screamed about email spy pixels till I was blue in the face, but it was building a serious set of defenses into HEY that turned the argument into action. And now the entire email tracking industry is about to be turned upside down, as Apple has announced they'll follow our lead, and block those abusive little beacons this Fall. Bam. That's what we learned at WWDC yesterday. iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey will all feature a new version of Apple's own Mail app that, just like HEY, can block email spy pixels, as well as route requests through a proxy to prevent leaking your IP address. Unfortunately, it sounds like Apple is going to make this new protection opt-in, but hopefully they'll present the option when they detect a spy pixel, just like HEY, not just hide it in some obscure settings panel somewhere. Either way, and given Apple's monopoly advantage with their preinstalled Mail app, we don't need much of an uptake from what they're calling Mail Privacy Protection to break the dam on spy pixels. You can't really say anything authoritatively about open rates if 5-10-30-50% of your recipients are protected against snooping, as you won't know whether that's why your spy pixel isn't tripping, or it's because they're just not opening your email. There's also simply no way users are going to willingly accept the premise of spy pixels if Apple presents the privacy dangers as clearly and as honestly as we've done in HEY. Apple already showed that with their drive to block unique ad identifiers for cross-app tracking in iOS 14.5: 96% of users in the US have declined to let apps track them like that! And email spy pixels are far worse and much creepier. It's going to be really interesting to see how long it takes the email tracking industry to adapt. I guess they'll probably cling to the wishful thinking that carried Facebook and other tracking giants until reality of Apple's App Tracking Transparency change provided the hard wall. People really do not like being tracked in everything they do online, and given the choice, will absolutely block it. But hopefully the smart providers will see the writing on the wall, and voluntarily cut the crap on spy pixels. This is what the big fish like Apple never seem to be able to internalize. That they need a rich ecosystem of small fish to push new ideas forward. That if they eat or starve us all, they might get the whole pond to themselves, but it'll be an awfully stale one.

First with The big ideas that animated our desire for Basecamp 2 and 3 were each time incompatible with the fundamental product design of the previous version, so we needed a rewrite to accommodate those ideas, and to ensure that people who liked working the old way still could continue doing so. That we weren't taking anything away from anyone that they liked using, because why? The technical rewrite was a consequence of those considerations, not the driver. I gave Enter Basecamp 4. For the past year or so, we've been in preproduction, while we've been riding the wild wave of success that has been HEY. Originally, we only intended for HEY to occupy our undivided attention for a few months after launch, but with many tens of thousands of customers to serve out the gate, it turned into more than that. So time on Basecamp 4 was spent identifying the leaps we wanted to make, That's kinda now. HEY is in a wonderful place. There's always more work to do, and we have a long list of exciting, quirky, and WEIRD features to continue to pursue, but we're in a place where we can chew gum and blow basecamp bubbles at the same time. So another rewrite, yeah? No. Turns out that all the great ideas we have for Basecamp 4 fit as a continuation of the product design we put in place with Basecamp 3, and the technical architecture is in great shape as well. Basecamp 4 just doesn't need to be a rewrite, so we're sure as hell not going to make it one, just because that's the weird path we had taken previously. Still. The first commit on Basecamp 3 was made on February 12, 2014. That's over seven years ago! Of course we've continued to evolve Basecamp 3 since, and the core majestic monolith is still gleaming in the sunshine. In fact, the architectural harness has not only carried us incredibly far, but when I examine the codebase today, I smile. This is still good. Very good. It's not full of cruft, not a graveyard of bad decisions, not a stacked ledger of technical debt. I'm mostly talking about the Ruby here. The JavaScript is a slightly different story. Basecamp 3 still has jQuery in it! Alongside Stimulus. Alongside Turbolinks. Alongside a bunch of other directions and styles. It was the examination of Basecamp 3's frontend that lead us to take the full step to So I've been working on retrofitting Hotwire into Basecamp, as part of the technical stage of preproduction for this upcoming fourth version. It's fascinating to see the jQuery styles in there. Then the leap to Stimulus. And now the next jump to Turbo It's also a little dangerous. When refactoring a codebase like Basecamp, it's always tempting to just pulling all the threads all at the same time. Then suddenly you're sitting with a ball of yarn instead of a functional sweater, and it's suddenly a long, cold walk home to a working application again. That's probably one of the most important lessons I took away from Besides the benefits to Basecamp, it's already easy to see the benefits to Hotwire on the horizon too. Basecamp is just a much bigger system than HEY in terms of screen count and functionality. My head is already full of ideas of how we can make Hotwire better still. And that's really the cycle of extraction-release-reintegration that's been animating me for all these years. You squint, see the future, then do the work to get there.

We must have wasted thousands of hours over the years on routine support questions for Basecamp that required technical expertise with a console to answer. Or to perform routine concierge tasks that we had built playbooks around, but that still required a technically-minded support person or even programmer to execute. Again and again and again. With HEY, we knew from the get-go that we simply couldn't launch that way. We had to be able to answer hard questions around deliverability from day one. It wasn't going to scale any other way. Email is both harder and more critical. So we built a wonderful operating tool to do these concierge tasks and inquiries from the start called Post Office. But Basecamp has been around for over 17 years, and we never had a proper support tool. This meant we had several people dedicated to doing that ad-hoc, playbook-run form of support. Which compensated for the lack of tooling, but at the cost of repetitive toil. We needed a support tool, and we hadn't built one, so we found ourselves paying for it many, many times over anyway. Inertia is a powerful force. It took living with HEY's Post Office to realize how badly we needed such a tool for Basecamp. So now the first version of Basecamp's support tool called Trek is here. It's still got a bit of that Cobbler's Children Syndrome right now, so it ain't pretty, but it works! Built to HEY spec on data safety, too. It's great to finally have, but why oh why didn't we listen to Mr Ford a decade ago 😄", "date": "2021-05-28T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Immediately. Game over, surveillance capitalism. The benefits from banning targeted ads won't stop with the protection of individual privacy, either. If Facebook and Google couldn't turn the worst sludge of the internet into gold through the alchemy of targeted ads, much of that gold would return to its rightful owners: the people creating great stuff. Targeted advertisement has reduced all content to commodities, which has its worth measured purely in \"engagement\". That nasty, viral post on Facebook is worth just as much as that deeply-researched magazine article, as long as the same number of people spend the same amount of time on it. That's been an utter disaster for journalism, for premium magazines, for everyone except the internet ad duopoly of Google and Facebook. So far proponents of targeted ads have been able to claim that actually many people like to be tracked because getting \"relevant ads\" is totally worth handing over all your personal data. There's been study after study showing how maybe only 60% of people would reject the stalking if given the choice. But the polls were wrong (probably because they were rigged!).

These are all the same sources that I used to consume, so it doesn't feel like I'm really missing anything – and what's missed, like the free-flow scrolling of Twitter, is a feature not a bug. Yet I spend so much less time and attention keeping up. This *how*of media consumption goes with pledge: That's it. Can't just go to these sites, or others, and scroll, and graze. Gotta wait for the email hitting [The Feed](https://hey.com/features/the-feed?source=hw-dhh). It's a completely artificial construct, of course. I could go to any of these places any time. It's not like I've blocked them from my browser. But now that it's been a few weeks, the results are astounding. The days literally seem longer. In the best possible sense. There's both more time to do more of the things I want to do, but also no attention spent on \"everything from everyone all the time\". It's been a complete revelation. Throttling Twitter in particular feels like a personal breakthrough. I took a complete two-month break last year, and it was wonderful, but I still ended up back. This trickle, just from a few people, feels like the trick that's going to make it stick. Barely there, but just enough. Temperance with a wink. Which of course led me to think about my own use of Twitter, and I've ultimately come to much the [same conclusion as I did with Instagram in 2018](https://medium.com/@dhh/regret-stergram-ea4073a64911). I don't want to contribute to *that*any more. So for now, it's over. Going forward, just links to HEY World posts, and whatever business boosts that come with it on the side. No direct engagement either. That's the flip side of the *how*of consuming media: the *how*of producing it. This, writing on HEY World, just feels so much better. Same thoughts, principles, but filtered through the bar of \"does this warrant a post\", and then shielded from the corrosive effects of likes and retweets and arguing with strangers on a stage. Ahhh. We'll see. Media dieting has about the same success rate for most people that actual dieting does. Which is to say abysmal. But I don't for a second regret quitting Facebook back in 2010, and I don't regret quitting Instagram in 2018 either (and that took two attempts as well!).

Particularly newsletters, which are full of images, styles, and tables. Showing these HTML emails inside a web-based email client is not a trivial problem. Unlike a normal HTML page that has the whole browser to itself, these HTML emails have to be shown inside the navigational chrome of the email client. You have to keep the HTML from the emails from interfering with each other, with the HTML of the email client itself, and show them at the right size. That means quarantining the rendering of the email, and ensuring text is scaled correctly, with images reflowing as intended, when they're shrunk.

But where most email clients have to tackle this problem from the perspective of rendering a single email, HEY's unique feature for reading newsletters called The Feed needs to deal with rendering as many of these HTML emails as you can scroll through.

The problem is that even rendering 8 of these HTML emails upfront, which is what we were doing until recently, is surprisingly taxing for a lot of devices! It's basically like opening 8 browser tabs concurrently. Modern computers are fast, but that's still a reasonable challenge if you want a sub-second response (especially when most newsletter HTML isn't exactly designed with the outmost care to lightness). Just look at how slow that was on even a modern Android phone, which is shown in the gif on the left. On the right, we're running the new version where the initial load is turned into a two-parter. Night'n'day difference. Now we just load 2 emails on the initial render (even on a tall screen, that'll fill the screen), then immediately load 6 more emails asynchronously as you're reading the first two, so that when you start scrolling, you'll still have the same 8 emails before a pagination break. We made this staged, endless pagination scheme in HEY using a few different components. First, we use geared pagination to load first 2, then 6 (right after the page is loaded), then 9 (once you scroll down), and then 12 emails per page (as you keep scrolling). This means the first loads are faster when you're just reading them in order, but we'll load ever more, as you might be scrolling a lot to search for something (someone using HEY might have hundreds of emails in The Feed – although hopefully they're recycling them regularly!). Second, we use a Stimulus-based pagination controller, which employs an IntersectionObserver to look for a page link tag to be scrolled into view, then triggers the pagination request, and automatically appends the new emails to the existing container. This combination means that the server-side code can essentially be written oblivious to the fact that pagination is going on.

That initial disclosure had some inconsistencies and omissions which led to an exhaustive investigation. It also included the arguments and graphics that, as Casey reported, positioned the existence of the list on a pyramid of escalations that can lead to genocide. The long-running existence of the \"Best Names Ever\" list that [employee 1] described yesterday represents a serious, collective, and repeated failure at Basecamp. One that we need to learn from together by transparently tracing its origin and history. Not only was it disrespectful to our customers, and a breach of basic privacy expectations, but it was also counter to creating an inclusive workplace. Nobody should think that maintaining such a list is okay or sanctioned behavior here. Furthermore, Jason and I should have caught this list. We are ultimately responsible for setting the tone of what's acceptable behavior at Basecamp, and in this instance we didn't. I'm sorry. Full history [An exhaustive investigative account of the who, when, where, and what regarding this list. Tracing its origin, maintenance, and ultimate deletion. Including a discussion of how this list had been discussed in chat rooms on two occasions.] Lessons Today, in 2021, I'd like to believe that many people would have raised concerns about this list, if it had come to their attention. Because times have changed. Sensibilities have changed. Awareness has changed. In fact, this is what happened, when concerns were raised last week and over the weekend. This is not a mark of failure in and of itself! Yes, I'm embarrassed that we didn't put a stop to this list far earlier. But there are limits to how much it makes sense to beat ourselves up about that. With today's clearer vision, it's apparent that it was wrong and inappropriate. That's progress! We have to be careful to celebrate that progress proportionally, though. I was dismayed to see the argument advanced in text and graphics on [Employee 1’s] post that this list should be considered part of a regime that eventually could lead to genocide. That's just not an appropriate or proportionate comparison to draw. And further more, I think it makes us less able to admit mistakes and accept embarrassment, without being tempted to hide transgressions in the past. If the stakes for any kind of bad judgement in this area is a potential link to a ladder that ends in genocide, we're off on a wrong turn. People make mistakes. Some times repeatedly. And some times they're blind to those mistakes until times or sensibilities change. That does not mean they're irredeemable people or deserve to have the most severe consequences exacted upon them. In the current environment, I can completely imagine another company overreacting to an incident like this. Furiously sanctioning, reprimanding, or even firing transgressors for having played any part. We're not going to do that at Basecamp. At Basecamp, we're going to honestly confront our mistakes, correct our wrongs, and then forgive, and move on. Of course, there are limits to that, and some transgressions can't follow such a path, but most probably can. And at any rate, there should be proportionality in our response. Onward. Following this account, several people at the company chimed in. Including someone who took objection to the deescalation I attempted in the write-up, and compounded the original analytical framework that used the genocide pyramid by expanding it with colonial atrocities and domestic terrorism. This employee had taken part in one of the chat room discussions where several names from the list had been bantered around for fun. So I replied: [Employee 2], I can appreciate how those examples raise the sensitivity of anything related to names, minorities, and power dynamics. Still, I don't think we serve the cause of opposing colonial regimes or racist ideology by connecting their abusive acts around names to this incident. And I don't think we serve an evaluation of you and others making fun of names in a Campfire session by drawing that connection either. We can recognize that forceful renaming by a colonial regime is racist and wrong while also recognizing that having a laugh at customer names behind their back is inappropriate and wrong without equating or linking the two. To take an example from the Campfire incident. The name [customer name] is an English surname that you can trace back to the 1500s. It's funny because it sounds like [phonetic connection to customer name]. Having a laugh at that does not connect you to any colonial or racist origins. It's inappropriate and wrong because it's disrespectful of the customer, a violation of basic expectations of privacy, and sets a bad cultural tone at Basecamp. Same too with the other name that was primarily made fun of in that Campfire session: [another customer name]. It's a surname that follows the Nordic style of \"Son of [that customer name]\". And it's again funny for phonetic reasons, because it starts with [word fragment from customer name]. [That word fragment] is just a funny word! It's still inappropriate for us to be laughing at individually named customers in our company Campfires, but not because there are any racist or colonial overtones to it. In fact, reviewing the original list in question, the vast majority of names on it fall into the category of the two specific examples above. It's not a list of, say, primarily Asian names. Out of the 78 names listed on the last version we were able to recover, just 6 names appear to be Asian. So connecting this to the shootings in Atlanta, because the Asian victims of that atrocity had their names misspelled in news reports, is exactly the kind of linkage I'd like us to avoid when we analyze our mistakes together at work. It needlessly creates this extremely high-stakes environment where inappropriately making fun of a name like [customer name of nordic heritage] can be rendered as part of some larger narrative of colonialism and racism that it just does not merit. Anyway, again, I completely appreciate that this is an incredible sensitive time when it comes to questions of identity, racism, and colonialism. Much more so than even just a few years ago when nobody called out that Campfire session analyzed above as being inappropriate or wrong, or sought to investigate the origins of the Best Names Ever list. We need to at once respect that sensitivity, not let it draw connections in overreach, and respond proportionally. We should in my opinion also be humble enough to recognize that if we participated in acts just a few years ago that we now consider deplorable, it's possible for others now to be where we were then without being irredeemable people. Doing all of that is not easy! But we can try, do our best, improve, and forgive ✌️❤️ This was the reply that triggered two anonymous complaints to HR. The one complaint included charges that the reply constituted discrimination against [employee 2] on the basis of race, gender, sexuality, or other protected-class attributes (though did not specify which exact attributes they felt this was targeted discrimination against) as well as a charge that it constituted harassment. I've read that reply many times now. I can't in my most critical reading find evidence or origin for the charges that this constituted protected-class discrimination or harassment. But obviously I'm not exactly an impartial party in the matter, so we followed our standard procedure regarding such complaints and sent it, along with all the context, to external labor lawyers for review. They concluded that no discrimination or harassment had occurred, and we shared their findings with the company. As you might imagine, tensions at Basecamp were pretty high following all of this. The Best Names List discussion had quickly devolved into employees hurling angry words at each other, and had to be closed by Jason. This was the second such discussion in a few months that had to be closed out following an acrimonious devolution that pitted employees against each other, and stressed these complicated power dynamics between managers and reports, all on a company-wide stage that invariably pulled everyone into the spectacle. Together with other acrimonious debates and inappropriate discussions with roots in societal politics on our internal communication systems, this formed the context that led to the recently announced changes. After going through repeated, worsening incidents like this, we took a hard look at why we kept doing this, and kept getting the same unproductive, unhealthy results. I've read some opinions on all of this that charge that facilitating these kinds of discussions, however acrimonious or uncomfortable or unresolved, is actually good, because a lot of life right now is acrimonious, uncomfortable, and unresolved, so work should reflect that. I can't get behind those arguments. As I wrote in the segment posted from our internal announcement of the changes, all of that, inasmuch as it does not directly relate to the business, is already so much of everyone's lives all the time on Twitter, Facebook, or wherever. Demanding that it also has to play out in our shared workspaces isn't going to lead anywhere good, in my opinion. But more so than just whether I think that's productive or healthy, a significant contingency of Basecamp employees had been raising private flags about this as well. Finding the discussions to be exactly acrimonious, uncomfortable, unresolved. Yet feeling unable to speak up out of fear that they'd have an accusatory label affixed to their person for refusing to accept the predominant framing of the issues presented by other more vocal employees. Which gets to the root of the dilemma. If you do indeed strive to have a diverse workforce both ideologically and identity wise, you're not going to find unison on all these difficult, contentious issues. If you did, you'd both be revealing an intellectual monoculture and we wouldn't be having these acrimonious debates. So if that is something you want, I continue to believe that a diverse workforce _should_ be something that you want, you have to consider what guardrails to put on the internal discourse. My belief is that the key to working with other people of different ideological persuasions is to find common cause in the work, in the relations with customers, in the good we can do in the industry. Not to repeatedly seek out all the hard edges where we differ. Those explorations are better left to the smaller groups, to discussions outside of the company-wide stage, and between willing participants. I respect that others will come to different conclusions on all of these questions. Particularly around whether the new direction we've set at Basecamp, where these societal political questions unrelated to work are being moved from company workspaces to private employee channels, is incompatible with what they want out of a company. We all have our principles, and I will always respect people who are willing to follow theirs. Yesterday, we offered everyone at Basecamp an option of a severance package worth up to six months salary for those who've been with the company over three years, and three months salary for those at the company less than that. No hard feelings, no questions asked. For those who cannot see a future at Basecamp under this new direction, we'll help them in every which way we can to land somewhere else. These are really hard questions. I've been inundated with emails from executives and employees who are wrestling with them at their companies. I hope that the airing of our dirty laundry, and the shitstorm its caused, can help others answer their own questions better. Whatever the answer they deem right for them. It's also a really hard time. We've always been a remote company, but we've never gone a year and a half without seeing each other. Normally, we'd all have met up thrice during this time to recharge, reconnect, and rehumanize. Add to that all the stress from the pandemic, from those societal politics, from, well, everything we've been through recently, and it's no wonder that everyone is extra vulnerable, extra quick to jump to conclusions, extra likely to escalate. We're human and that's a human response. At Basecamp, it's going to be a tough transition. We've committed to a deeply controversial stance, some employees are relieved, others are infuriated, and that pretty well describes much of the public debate around this too. But this too shall pass. We've been in business for over twenty years. Been through a myriad of controversies and challenges, and we'll be through this too. Onward, indeed.", "date": "2021-04-28T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

This is nature, this is normal. While some conservatives love to throw the word snowflake around as an insult, I take it as a compliment. The most interesting people I know really are unique, quirky, and even contradictory. To illustrate, I'm going to list some political statements that I agree with, and you try to form an opinion of who I am just based on those: While some conservatives love to throw the word snowflake around as an insult, I take it as a compliment. The most interesting people I know really are unique, quirky, and even contradictory. To illustrate, I'm going to list some political statements that I agree with, and you try to form an opinion of who I am just based on those: - Israel's occupation of Palestine is an apartheid regime. - Abortion should be legal and accessible, with some restrictions. - Structural racism is a big problem in America. Those are three political topics that have been lightning rods in America for decades. And if you take just those three, you're going to form an impression of someone on Team Liberal/Left (although even those terms and their fit to these issues have their own controversies to untangle!). But let's keep going. Let's do another three: - Russiagate was a mass delusion. - Parler's eviction from the internet was wrong. - Trump was mostly right on trade with China. Now things are getting murky! Those all sound like Team Conservative/Right positions? If you draw a Venn diagram for those six positions, the area that overlaps is going to be pretty small. The number of people who'd agree with me keeps shrinking for every controversial position taken. Now imagine instead of six positions, we eventually end up examining many more. I've been writing on the internet for over twenty years, so in my case, I've probably publicly endorsed hundreds if not thousands of controversial positions. And in that time, surely changed my mind on more than a few as well. How many people do you think would agree with me on everything I've ever written? Nobody, that's how many. (Not even me!). That's without even considering a current set of positions that many would consider contradictory in terms, like: - Cars are really fun. Cars don't belong in cities. - Climate change is a catastrophic problem. I like burgers. - Encryption is good. Bitcoin is bad. These three contradictions probably rank lower on the scale of existential stress for most people than do the first six (except maybe saying Bitcoin is bad 😂), though, so you can discuss them casually with more people without ending up hitting identity bedrocks. But those first six? There are very few people who I'd willingly sit down to have a good-faith, substantial discussion with about those. Because the odds are that we'll run sour quickly. Those debates need the right context, the right people, the right frame of mind. And at work? No, never. Especially at work! Especially because work involves all sorts of delicate power balances already. If I end up in a debate with an employee at Basecamp that hits identity bedrock, we're both going to be put in a hard situation (and the odds are low that any of the rocks are going to move). Does that mean nobody should ever discuss these big, important topics? Of course not! We need vigorous debate in a free society. But as the joke goes, \"Sir, this is a Wendy's\". Not every place is the right place. Not every time is the right time. The way some people deal with this is by accepting an ideological package deal. Then you can adopt a whole slew of orthodoxies that a certain group has agreed upon being The Correct Takes. This gives a real sense of belonging and security. We're good and right, they're bad and wrong. Easy! Well, easy deal, hard bargain. Not only will the ideological package deal keep evolving, usually without affording you much control or say in the matter, but it'll also stoke all the tribal proclivities you're hardwired for. And that'll take most people to an increasingly rigid and intolerant place. It'll also increase the feeling of betrayal if you *thought*someone was on your team, but then they reveal a blasphemous position that runs counter to the orthodoxies. That traitor! They must only believe this because [list of speculative, terrible reasons]. We all have our own red lines. Positions we find so beyond the pale that they're instant deal breakers. Good, fine, break those deals. But the more lines you accumulate, the more cross you're going to get. The more constrained your tolerance for coexisting with others. So at very least ask yourself: did I collect too many? Are these the right ones?", "date": "2021-04-27T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

By far the most controversial is a new etiquette around societal politics at work, and the stances we'll take as a company. So to expand on that, here's a segment from what I wrote internally on that topic, as part of the announcement to employees at Basecamp. As cliché as it may sound, these are very difficult times in many places of the world, and in America in particular. We're constantly confronted with terrible tragedies, pulled into polarized political fights, and egged on by social media to engage. There are many places to be involved, exposed, and engaged in those conversations. Basecamp shouldn't be one of those places. Basecamp should be a place where employees can come to work with colleagues of all backgrounds and political convictions without having to deal with heavy political or societal debates unconnected to that work. You shouldn't have to wonder if staying out of it means you're complicit, or stepping into it means you're a target. That is difficult enough outside of work, but almost impossible at work. By trying to have the debates around such incredibly sensitive societal politics inside the company, we're setting ourselves up for strife, with little chance of actually changing anyone's mind. These types of discussions are so difficult that even if we were having them at the best of times, together in person, with trust batteries fully charged, we'd struggle. And we have none of those advantages right now, so it's not a surprise the results have been poor. We also like to tell ourselves that having these discussions with the whole company is 'healthy'. I used to think that too, but I no longer do. I think it's become ever more stressful, unnerving, and counterproductive. No comment thread on Basecamp is going to close the gap on fundamental philosophical and political differences. And we're left worse for wear when we try. Therefore, we’re asking everyone, including Jason and me, to refrain from using our company Basecamp or HEY to discuss societal politics at work effective immediately. This includes everything from sharing political stories in campfire, using message threads to elucidate others on political beliefs that go beyond the topic directly, or performing political advocacy in general. If you're in doubt as to whether your choice of forum or topic for a discussion is appropriate, please ask before posting. But if you make a mistake, it's not the end of the world. Someone will gently remind you of the etiquette, and we'll move on. This isn't some zero-tolerance, max-consequences new policy. We encourage you to continue these difficult discussions with willing colleagues on other systems. Signal is an excellent choice that provides end-to-end encryption and group support. We also encouraged you to exercise your right to activism and political engagement outside of work. It's none of Basecamp's business how or whether you choose to spend your time, money, or voice to support charities, causes, or political action groups. Note that we will continue to engage in politics that directly relate to our business or products. This means topics like antitrust, privacy, employee surveillance. If you're in doubt as to whether something falls within those lines or not, please, again, reach out for guidance. Next, Basecamp, as a company, is no longer going to weigh-in publicly on societal political affairs, outside those that directly connect to the business. Again, everyone can individually weigh-in as much or as little as they want, but we're done with posts that present a Basecamp stance on such issues. Aftermath Unsurprisingly, parts of Twitter is very. disappointed. in. us. And the search for the tweet to serve as a stake for that disappointment is in full swing. Several contenders have included my tweets about how I find it OK for leaders and employees to be political on Twitter. I still do! And I still will be. Not just on twitter, but on this here blog as well. These are my personal spaces. Everyone at Basecamp has been, as you can read from the snippet above, actively encouraged to do the same! Bring all your political advocacy to whatever personal spaces you have. Twitter, Facebook, your local advocacy group, all of it. Just don't bring it into the internal communication platforms we use for work, unless it directly relates to our business. I'm applying that same standard to myself, and Jason is too.

I'm sympathetic to why we did that – given just the endless avalanche of requests! – but a mistake it was. The first problem with roadmaps, and other kinds of explicit or implicit promises, is that illusion of agreement I spelled out 14 years ago: Like functional specs earlier in the development phase, product road maps are fraught with trouble. The due diligence process is usually twice as shallow, which means that you’ll inevitably end up promoting illusions of agreement. When all we have to agree on is a slogan, like “Meetings Tab, 4th Quarter”, it becomes an empty imagination box that’ll fit wildly different expectations. Disappointment, however, is sure to ensue when only one set of expectations can actually be met. When we let people know that we were working on custom domains for HEY, we hadn't figured out exactly how to do it, and we say as much. But since we weren't specific, it allowed a whole class of customers to imagine what custom domains could or should be like, only for some of them to be disappointed when that personal conception didn't match reality. This. Always. Happens! Sure, for some people, the solution for custom domains we brought out turned out to be exactly what they were looking for. Neat separation between accounts, yet still integrated with a unified login and inbox. But that just meant we met their expectations! Nothing too exciting, just, you know, finally! We knew this was going to happen, yet we did it anyway. Which highlights the limitations of knowledge. It's not enough to know something, you have to live it.

Endless fields for machine learning to roam wild, sowed by the anxiety of WHAT IF I NEED IT ONE DAY. But saving every email you've ever gotten does not make any sense. Neither ecologically, practically, or mentally. Why are you saving newsletters from three years ago? Or notifications from even last month? And do you really want a digital trail of everything you've ever written anyone? I don't think most people do, but I also don't think they've thought about it too hard. Storing all those emails that are only ever going to be read again by machines is something we should stop doing. There are entire data centers dedicated to storing all this crap forever. Soaking up resources to build, maintain, and power. Why? It was Earth Day yesterday. And I wish we'd been able to get this feature ready for its celebration, but we didn't think about it until the day before, so the next best thing was a preview instead of a launch: HEY will now come with a recycling center for emails. This is just v1, and I can imagine taking this much further, but it's a great start. In the HEY Recycling Center, you'll be able to turn on recycling for The Feed as the most obvious improvement. Newsletters are email hogs as it is. Full of HTML markup to support every all sorts of ancient email clients. They're usually just skimmed once, if at all, so just end up sitting there, taking up space on disk, in search results, in everywhere, for no good reason. Easiest recycling win ever. But you'll also be able to turn on recycling for any individual sender or domain. Most people get the bulk of their emails from a handful of senders. For me, the most egregious one is GitHub. Some days I get well over a hundred notification emails from GitHub, relating to programming work I'm doing at Basecamp, Ruby on Rails, or Hotwire. I like getting them, I skim them quickly, but why on earth would I keep them until the end of time? So GitHub will go on the most aggressive recycling schedule. I can imagine doing the same with anyone I'm emailing with where I would have turned on Signal's Disappearing Messages feature if we were texting. Which is now actually the default for almost every conversation I have on there. There's such liberation in knowing that not everything you ever said is going to live in a hoard of data forever. It's a lightness that's hard to articulate. Corporate email systems have long had crude recycling options under the name of retention policies. Those policies usually dictate that every email from every sender get erased after a certain time, unless you specifically pluck them out for retention. After having been subject to an invasive subpoena before, I can completely recognize the appeal of doing that. But most people don't need to worry about lawsuits, and HEY isn't trying to appeal to some corporate compliance department, so for us the recycling appeal is broader and closer and motivates being more specific. We really all do need to think about what we can do, big and small, to squander fewer resources. Recycling your emails isn't going to turn any big tides, but if it's easy to do, helps you anyway, why wouldn't you?", "date": "2021-04-23T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

As well as all the other books we've written together. There aren't many blogs that've been around for that long, been part of shaping so many consequential debates, and helped so many people see things differently. Since 1999, but now no more. After twenty two years we've decided to end SvN. Over the past few years, Jason and I simply lost some of the energy and nerve for writing there. The kind Signal v Noise had when it was best. Not because our intrinsic energy or nerve had vanished, but because the company blog no longer felt like the place to put it. I'm still not entirely sure why that is. Maybe it was the lure of Twitter that zapped some of the zest. Maybe it was the weight of running a larger company that finally caught up to us. Maybe it was a change in the times. But writing for Signal v Noise no longer felt effortless. Writing for HEY World does. Feel effortless, that is. Jason and I now both write unapologetically from our own, personal perspectives again. In part because HEY World is just an email, in part because we're now clearly speaking for ourselves again. That's when I enjoy writing the most. When it's effortless. When the words just pour out of my fingers, and I can hit send a few edits later. When it stops feeling like that, I stop writing. And instead end up taking the ideas to a cheap, ephemeral medium like Twitter, only to waste those thoughts on the void. But don't I feel bad about us ending a blog with such history and provenance? No. I don't. I'm just not a nostalgic person. In fact, I'm deeply skeptical of nostalgia. It too often feels like a trap to romanticize the past at the expense of the future. If you fall in love with who you once were, it's too easy to forget to keep going. I want to keep going. On the flipside, I enjoy the idea of a legacy. But as milestones in the rearview mirror. There to remind you of where you were, but without any obligation to stop and linger and fawn over every one. 20, 21, 22... Keep going. So that's what the end of Signal v Noise feels like to me. A set of milestones. Twenty years of milestones. But no nostalgia. Besides, this isn't a wake. It's a celebration! Both Jason and I have writtenmore in the past two months ago, since the launch of HEY World, than we had in more than a year previously. That's the spirit of Signal v Noise, the writing. The legacy is still there. We'll maintain them until the end of the internet, just like we do with our products. And then we'll keep going, keep thinking, keep prodding, keep provoking, keep writing.

They called it a phone, but the revolution was shrinking a general-purpose computer to fit in your pocket. That was the progress. But when Apple introduced the App Store the next year, it cemented the fundamental regression that had been present with the iPhone since launch. That it was a general-purpose computer that was only allowed to run software specifically approved by Apple, unlike any other mainstream general-purpose computer in history. Including Apple's own Mac computer. In the early days, we all failed to realize just what a monumental and fundamental regression that really was. That consumers could pay hundreds of dollars for a pocket computer, and yet not be allowed to run whatever software they so pleased, unless it had Apple's blessing. Like this wasn't a computer at all, but a gaming console or carrier-locked flip phone. But back then, the market was growing explosively, whole new frontiers of app development were opened, and developers left whatever principled opposition they might have had at the door to be able to compete. And besides, Apple's enforcement remained comparably light touch, as long as they kept selling ever-more expensive phones in ever-more markets around the world. That all came to an end with the so-called Pivot To Services circa 2017. Apple's new strategy for a peak iPhone world where new growth had to come from making more money off existing customers rather than finding new ones or selling the same people new iPhones every year or two. That was when Apple started realizing and exercising the latent monopoly power available in controlling the largest and most profitable share of the US pocket computer market. And developers started waking up to the precarious situation they found themselves in, if they had a business selling any kind of digital services. The App Store tollbooth during that time not only expanded who were due to pay, but served as a competitive cudgel to beat competitors like Spotify even when Apple were desperately late to market with me-too services like Apple Music Streaming. Apple has since shown in market after market – be that gaming bundles, news aggregation, TV-show production, fitness training, payment gateways, you name it – that they can use their iPhone monopoly to gain an unfair advantage in any other market, and the App Store is the main vehicle to commit those antitrust offenses. The stock market has responded with ferocious enthusiasm. We went from a bear story of peak iPhone to Apple surpassing two trillion dollars in market cap, or four times the valuation from 2017, off the prospects and profits of these monopoly rents. Lawmakers and regulators and all the rest of us, however, are finally waking up to just what an insufferable situation that is for everyone but Apple. And quickly too. When the pivot to services was announced in 2017, there was very little antitrust interest in the App Store problem. Now it's being examined and sought countered in the US at a state and federal level with both legislation and enforcement. And so too in Europe and elsewhere. I lived through hell for two weeks last year when Apple threatened to destroy our new email service HEY.com, unless we yielded 30% of our revenues. We took a stand and gave Apple a bloody nose then. Epic has since, by virtue of their size, been able to take the fight directly to Apple in a court of law as well. Something a small or midsized developer would be ill advised to do, given the prospects spending a decade in the courts and tens of millions in legal fees. That legal fight is in fact exposing the underlying fallacy in Apple's key argument for its App Store monopoly tollbooth. That Apple needs to exert total control to give consumers total safety. The reality is that Apple has been hiring unqualified staff to spend mere minutes reviewing new apps, and as a consequence has let countless scams operate for years, sucking millions of dollars out of consumers, all under the guise that they were perfectly safe. The App Store is classic monopoly tollbooth that Apple is trying to justify by operating a security theater. It's time for that show to end.", "date": "2021-04-20T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Patrick McGee from the Financial Times revealing scam upon scam in the App Store, I have to admit I didn't quite get it. How were all these multi-million dollar scams being allowed into the App Store in the first place? And why weren't they being expediently removed when scores of customers complained in their 1-star reviews?The answer turns out to be as simple as it is depressing: Apple's App Store was never designed to work. At least not in the way the company purports that it does. Apple presents the App Store as a highly curated, secure mall of apps which have been thoroughly vetted, and that you can safely install without any due diligence. But it's not and you shouldn't.As part of Epic's lawsuit against Apple, we've come to learn that app reviewers typically review 50-100 apps. Some times spending less than a minute reviewing an individual app. We've also learned that these reviewers are hired without any technical background, let alone any particular expertise with the iOS or macOS platforms.There's a term for a practice like this: security theater.That's not because of individual failings amongst app reviewers, but because nobody could possibly provide real security reviews with a workload like that. Even if they were highly qualified, which, in the case of app reviewers, they're also not.Apple's own actual security people know this all too well. Patrick McGee from the Financial Times reports:A senior Apple engineer compared the defences of its App Store against malicious actors to “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gunfight”, according to legal documents released on Thursday. This really should have been obvious in retrospect. Apple brags that they have in the App Store. How could they possibly review all of them properly up front? millions of applicationsThe App Store is far more akin to the general internet than it is to any traditional software store. It's impossible to preemptively vet all of the internet, so security on the internet is instead based on hardened browsers, isolated processes, restricted device access, and other system-level protective techniques. This is also how Apple manages macOS. You can install whatever software you'd like on your Mac, but the operating system provides a depth of protections to ensure apps don't get access to data it shouldn't. This model works! Apple's macOS is not overrun with security exploits and malware. No, it's not foolproof, and bad software does exist, but as Kosta has extensively documented, so too does it in the iOS App Store. The key benefit Apple derives from using overworked and under-qualified personnel to review apps is business model enforcement and competitive leverage. App reviewers don't need any technical chops to threaten apps with expulsion from the store lest they pay up nor do they need security expertise to deny apps that are being Sherlocked. And as with security theater elsewhere, Apple can externalize the cost of the performance. App developers are the ones suffering from the inconsistent, capricious, and infuriating decisions made by reviewers who might at most spend a few minutes reviewing the work that took months or years to complete. That is a recipe for resentment. The vague App Store guidelines – that are interpreted differently depending on which reviewer you happen to be assigned – are not meant to provide smooth, consistent passage through a rigorous but fair security and safety review process. They're meant to give Apple the cover to do whatever they want, whenever they want, to whomever they please. It's the essence of absolutist rule. It does not have to be like this! It's completely within reach for Apple to admit that the current approach is broken. I know admitting mistake is not an institutional virtue at Apple, but if the company could finally come to realize that the butterfly keyboard was fundamentally bust, I have some faith that they might come to realize the same about the absolutist App Store regime. Apple needs to admit that they can't have millions of apps and project a picture of perfect safety. They should focus on the system-level protections like they do with their browser and with their entire macOS operating system. Then drop the security theater that's seeding cynicism. Apple must accept their unique and critical position as the dominant maker of pocket computers in the US. Treat that role with the respect of a common carrier. Embrace net neutrality principles and treat all app makers the same regardless of business model or competitive standing with Apple's own offerings. I want to believe that Apple doesn't actually want to be this monopolist bully. Steve Jobs’ original vision for the iPhone was that developers would make apps that ran via the web. No gatekeeping, safety provided by system-level protections. Apple should re-embrace the principles behind that vision applied to our native app world. The tragedy of Darth Apple can still end in redemption. There's good underneath that monopoly mask. Take it off, Tim.", "date": "2021-04-09T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Wilkinson was inspired by our funding model – bootstrapped from consulting – but didn't follow any of the principles that go with that model:Don't spend more than you make. If you're profitable, you're free. Even if the show one day ends, you made money every year along the way, so there won't be a black hole where your bank account once was, and you won't be roiled by regret.Growth is not the goal. Wilkinson seems obsessed with Asana and 'winning' the market. If you define your success by whether you're beating a competitor or you're winning some arbitrarily-defined market, you'll be sucked into playing a game where they set the rules.Half, not half-assed. Flow spread itself thin thinking 'the market' had set certain non-negotiable bars, so unless they had, say, an Android app RIGHT NOW, they'd be toast. This led to a me-too, low-quality product full of bugs. Instead of focusing on a smaller, more opinionated, more differentiated product.Under-do the competition. Wilkinson's tale of regret is steeped in war metaphors. Bringing bigger, badder weapons to this imaginary war with Asana. Locked into a Cold War one-upping game. Of course you're going to lose if you define your company and your product on the competition's terms, try to copy whatever they're doing, but don't have half the money to do so.Don't out-spend, out-teach. Wilkinson didn't have anything to say and neither did Flow once they started chasing a competitor's agenda. So instead of building an audience by being different and interesting they started losing customers by being a worse copy of a better funded competitor. Wilkinson's chief regret seems to be that he spent millions of his own money If you run your company like it was VC funded without the venture capital, yeah, you're going to wish you had just taken other people's money. But even if you do, that is absolutely no guarantee of success! The vast majority of startups fail. Especially those chasing unicorn dreams. Even if they take other people's money.

If you see yourself in that billionaire aspiration, that unicorn-or-bust mentality, do you know what? You probably should go the venture route. You'll almost certainly fail, because those are just the odds of the venture game, but at least you'll be spending other people's money to do so. If you look at the idea of running a company of 10-20 people that would make you millions of dollars over the duration, then chasing a dream to become a billionaire off a todo app. That's about as far as it could possibly be from our story and advocacy on entrepreneurship as you could get.

Todoist is from the same era of Flow, and they look to be doing well by all accounts, and they didn't raise any venture capital either. And of course Basecamp itself is partly a todo list manager.As long as we're playing with counterfactuals, why not imagine a universe where Wilkinson hadn't stared himself blind on a venture-funded competitor, and instead followed some of the principles listed above. One where he had kept developing a differentiated product, focused on smaller companies as Asana chased the enterprise, and most of all lived well within Flow's means while making $1-3 million dollars a year. That could have been a wonderful business!But as Wilkinson says, that wasn't the ambition. Running a $1-3m/year company that might have employed 10 people and kicked off millions in profits over the years wasn't going to make him a billionaire.

I don't think the world is better off by erasing the need to trust in our transactional counterparts, so turning these transactions into pure computing always struck me as a regression. (There are a million other reasons why I think crypto is kryptonite, but let's not even get into that.) People have rightfully become skeptical and cynical about how companies on the internet will treat their data. It's hard to trust when you've been screwed over time and again. And the dominant intersection of surveillance advertisement and venture capital means this skepticism continues to be well warranted. But it doesn't have to be this way. And, really, it's better when it's not. Trust is good, but trust doesn't scale. You can trust people, you can't trust corporations. I remember when we switched Basecamp's payment processing to Braintree. Yes, they had a nice API, their rates were good, but really, we switched to Braintree back in the day because of Bryan Johnson, the CEO. I trusted Bryan. He was in Chicago, like us. He responded himself. There was a connection. I felt like he wouldn't screw us over (and he didn't!). I didn't have a relationship with Braintree the company. And now that they're owned by a faceless corporation, the trust is gone. We're still there because of inertia, not allegiance. Which means trust isn't a commodity. It can't be transferred in a sale, and as I said, it doesn't scale. Trust is personal. This is a feature not a bug! The world would be better off if more companies were kept at a more human scale where trust can happen. This is a key reason why so many people like independent shops.

That's why most mission statements ring so hollow. They're filled with free platitudes, and thus provide no guidance on how to actually drive \"the mission\" when trade-offs must be made. That's by design. The flowery mission statement is usually meant as a fig leaf over the real mission: grow as fast as possible / make as much money as possible. But every now and then you will encounter a company that actually does pay for its principles. That's how brands are burnished. Standing for something is a risk, so it takes courage and conviction. We admire people who fight the fights worth fighting, and so too with companies. Is Apple one of those companies? Does Apple really stand for something? I used to say \"yes\" without hesitation. That's why I was a mostly unreserved fan for so many years. Now there are many reservations, and many new doubts, but I still want to believe. Perhaps not in the grand narrative, they're just too big for that, but in specific areas where the remnants of the old pirate ethos still linger. Take privacy. It's probably the key reason why I still use the iPhone. I simply trust Apple more than Google when it comes to protecting my privacy. Google's entire business model rests on the industrial-scale violation of said privacy. Apple merely flirts with such violations when it suits other purposes, and it's not where the big bucks are made. That's a key structural difference between these two monopolists, which otherwise share similar tactics. So given the real difference in business models, Apple has been able to own the principle of privacy for free. It doesn't really cost Apple anything to mandate privacy labels for apps, so they do, and they reap the applause. It doesn't cost Captain Cook anything to shoot across the bow at Facebook for its privacy violations, so he does whenever he can. But things are about to get interesting. Apple will finally get a chance to test the courage and conviction of its commitment to privacy. The upcoming iOS 14.5 will start asking users whether apps can track them with a unique identifier (which can be used to follow them around different apps and on the web). Facebook is clearly petrified that if users get the choice, most will say no, and their ability to sell surveillance advertising will be seriously harmed. Good, I say! Facebook's opposition is hardly a test, though. Apple is clearly the alpha in that relationship. Facebook needs Apple more than Apple needs Facebook. So they have the leverage, and Cook seems to live for that flex. No, the test is China. Patrick McGee at FT broke the story that Tencent and ByteDance, along with the state-backed China Advertising Association, have devised a workaround to the changes in iOS 14.5, such that they can continue to track users across apps without triggering the new permission dialog. This workaround is called CAID, and was briefly described online, before it got yanked, but The Wayback Machine caught it. So Chinese tech giants, with the explicit backing of the Chinese government, are telling Apple that they're not going to comply with the new privacy controls, and basically daring \"and what are you going to do about it??\". This has all sorts of echoes of when Google bailed on China in 2010 over censoring search results (and later Gmail hacking). That did cost Google, and they later tried to recoup on those losses with the Dragonfly project, but the stakes are entirely larger for Apple. Apple is frequently making in excess of ten billion dollars PERQUARTER in China. Last one blew all records and topped twenty billion, making up 20% of Apple's total revenue! That's good for Apple. It's less clear how this matters to China. If Apple was to leave the Chinese market tomorrow, those sales would likely just go to Huawai or Xiaomi. Local companies where profits stay in China, and companies that are even easier than Apple to control (not that Apple is putting up much of a fight!). Sounds like a Chinese win-win? Surely Apple knows this. Which is why it's so interesting! Apple will be forced to weigh the value of its commitment to privacy against the value of billions in Chinese revenue. Because if they stick to their privacy guns, kill CAID, and anger the Chinese government in the process, it's not exactly a stretch to imagine how that might mean trouble. Maybe even a showdown. Maybe even a forced exit from the Chinese market. On the other hand, Apple can't credibly let Tencent and ByteDance get away with skirting the protections in iOS 14.5, putting Facebook at a serious disadvantage against those two. It's perhaps the one plank in this sea of antitrust waves where Facebook comes out looking sympathetic. I could well imagine US senators writing concerned letters to Apple if they let Facebook's competitors get away with privacy murder while handcuffing the national champion. I gotta say, this is a delicious pickle! I'm going to enjoy it with a side of popcorn. I'm sure Apple would like for nothing better than to strike a backroom deal without public scrutiny that lets it run a one-company-two-systems policy towards privacy in the world. Cook already demonstrated with his pandering to the Trump administration that he has no qualms about moral compromises if it means an economic advantage for Apple (\"I'll trade you a humiliating photo op for a break on tariffs, Mr Trump!\"). But maybe that pony dance was deemed worth it, since the cost was measured only in Cook's dignity. These stakes are different. So what's it gonna be, Apple?

The killer, played by Kevin Spacey, has been reading Dante's Divine Comedy, Milton's Paradise Lost, and other books about the seven deadly sins, and he's been borrowing those books from the library. That's how they get him. This plot device was likely inspired by a real program started by the FBI in 1973 called the Library Awareness Program. It was revealed by the New York Times in 1987, leading to congressional hearings and librarians forming a code of conduct not to rat out their patrons' reading habits. I've been thinking about how this scene, and the real-life program that likely inspired it, recalls how Americans used to have a deep appreciation for the idea that what you read is none of anyone's business. It's not hard to see why this used to be such a strongly-held principle. In 1987, with the Cold War still on, and the memories of the Are You Now Or Have You Ever Been A Communist inquisition still fresh, people surely weren't keen to be outed for having an interest in the writings of Karl Marx or other socialist writers. Neither to the FBI nor to their fellow Americans behind those white picket fences. How bizarre it would have seemed back then to learn that in the future your reading habits would not only be tracked forever by Big Tech, and thus available to any agent with a subpoena, but broadcast to the world in a variety of uncomfortable ways. Like, oh, the fact that who you follow on Twitter is public for all to see (and judge). As the cancelation drive accelerates in the US, I've for the first time thought about how my own reading habits might be scrutinized. How following certain people on Twitter can be cast as 'toxic behavior'. We're well into the phase where the rings of incrimination are spreading. It's bad to be the original author of subversive writings, but it's increasingly bad to be a reader as well. I've been on Twitter for a long time, and over the years I've certainly had my fair share of controversies and pushback. Tweeting about Bitcoin stands out as a topic that would often attract a brigade of boosters eager to educate me in forceful ways about just how wrong I was about crypto. But that is now a faint memory compared to any time I dare retweet the writings of Glenn Greenwald or Matt Taibbi. Now, I invite that on by choosing to publicly flaunt that I read both, but the tone of the feedback is a public flaunt too. A clear signal that to some people, even reading these writers is now a serious cultural transgression. I'd certainly forgive anyone not looking to risk those condemning eyes for refraining from having either writer in their public following list on Twitter. It's bizarre you can't easily make your reading habits private on Twitter. You either have to hack the system with private lists, turn your account private, or keep a separate burner account with your subversive reading list. That's backwards. Email has it right. As long as you're not using Gmail or other Big Tech surveillance systems, who you write, who you read, and particularly which newsletters you subscribe to is none of anyone's business. As it should be. What's so nuts about the current atmosphere is how outlandish it seemed even five minutes ago. When Republican congress members wanted to drag the Big Tech antitrust discussion into 'conservative censorship' last summer, I rolled my eyes. Then followed the crude suppression of the Hunter Biden story from the NYPost, Parlor's destruction, a cancelation drive that was hard to keep up with, and the endless consternation over when someone should lose the privilege to publish on the internet. I don't roll my eyes any longer. Which is also not the same as buying into the full conservative grievance arc, the nonsensical proposed remedies (revoke 230!), or even having a final opinion on how to address social media's role in spreading QAnon or vaccine conspiracy theories. These are big, difficult questions. And it's clear that we don't have big, easy answers. (Though we could start by defunding the incentive to spread by banning targeted advertisement!). But it has given me a renewed vigor to seek out subversive, alternative voices. To broaden my reading habits further, rather than shrink them down. And to hope others are able to do the same, without fearing the social pressure within their tribal circle, because they can do so in private. We need to bring back the idea that custodians of your reading habits, be they librarians or social media operators or online book sellers, should take a professional oath to keep your reading habits private. That you should feel free to read writers across a broad spectrum, even, or perhaps particularly, if you don't generally agree with them. We need to rediscover that vintage spirit of what you read being none of anyone's business.", "date": "2021-03-16T00:00:00", "author": "dhh"}

Not just activity spent on competing or adjacent services, no, all activity of any kind. Any time spent outside their service equating to minutes on the clock to conquer. The latest example of this totalitarian approach to the attention economy came from The latest example of this totalitarian approach to the attention economy came from Spotify's CEO Daniel Ek in an interview with The Verge: Do you worry about Clubhouse taking people away from the time they typically listened to podcasts? Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel, said 30 years ago, 'Only the paranoid survive,' and it's definitely something that I think he was right in assuming. But I'm paying as much attention to Clubhouse as I am looking at Fortnite, or Minecraft, or Roblox. All forms of media and entertainment is minutes that could have been spent listening to audio instead. So we're definitely paying attention to it. Every minute is a minute you could have spent listening to audio on Spotify. How depressing is that. How And just how perverted is the idea that there are tech executives measuring the total sum our human minutes, plotting how they might convert video-game time into podcast-listening time, how they might counter an interest in social media, such that they can rack up more streams. It's straight out of a dystopian novel. Daniel Ek is not exactly the first to declare total war on attention either. Just a few years ago, Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings was even more ambitious when he expanded the addressable market beyond waken hours and into sleep. Here he is on obsessive is that. And just how perverted is the idea that there are tech executives measuring the total sum our human minutes, plotting how they might convert video-game time into podcast-listening time, how they might counter an interest in social media, such that they can rack up more streams. It's straight out of a dystopian novel. Daniel Ek is not exactly the first to declare total war on attention either. Just a few years ago, Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings was even more ambitious when he expanded the addressable market beyond waken hours and into sleep. Here he is on an earnings call with investors: Because the market is just so vast. You know, think about it, when you watch a show from Netflix and you get addicted to it, you stay up late at night. You really —we're competing with sleep, on the margin. And so, it's a very large pool of time. That wasn't a slip of the tongue. Hastings made the same point the year before when sleep was mentioned on a list of competitors that also included Snapchat. Just think about that for a second. This is the CEO of the world's premiere streaming service, musing with investors about how he might capture more service minutes if he can steal your sleep. That's just a mind-blowing corporate directive to hear said out loud. And it suddenly makes features like Netflix's rapid start of a new episode look downright predatory. Even the term 'binge watching' deserves a second read in light of this insatiable thirst for attention. Here's the dictionary: binge, noun: a period of excessive indulgence in an activity, especially eating, drinking, or taking drugs: he went on a binge and was in no shape to drive | a drinking binge. That is.. depressingly accurate? You are indeed in no shape to drive if Netflix stole your sleep. From Why We Sleep: This coming week, more than 2 million people in the US will fall asleep while driving their motor vehicle.. As a result, 1.2 million accidents are caused by sleepiness each year in the United States. You may find it surprising to learn that vehicle accidents caused by drowsy driving exceed those caused by alcohol and drugs combined. Drowsy driving alone is worse than driving drunk. What's bizarre about both Ek and Hastings is that neither even earn on a per-minute basis! They both make their billions from subscriptions. As long as someone stays subscribed to Spotify or Netflix, Ek and Hastings should be happy. But they're not, because, like Ek revealed by quoting Andy Grove, they're paranoid. Paranoid that unless you spend all your time with them, you might not renew next month. If they can get you to literally sacrifice sleep, quit playing so many video games, and stop talking to your friends on Snapchat, then you'll be theirs and theirs alone. That is a pathological degree of neediness. There are actually companies that do profit when their total war of attention conquers another minute. Like Facebook. Every minute you spend enraged by the newsfeed is a minute Zuckerberg can monetize. Here's a quote from a former Facebook employee before the House Antitrust Committee: 'Your only job is to get an extra minute,' the former employee told the subcommittee. 'It's immoral. They don't ask where it's coming from. They can monetize a minute of activity at a certain rate. So the only metric is getting another minute.' I mean. Fuck. Is that really what we've been reduced to? A set of eyeballs (or earballs??) to be squeezed until every last tear of attention is drained. The image of human batteries powering the simulation is barely a metaphor at this point. We need a completely new set of ethics to counter this assault on our attention. One that looks at binge watching as the excessive indulgence it is. Not something to be proud about, and certainly not something companies should feel comfortable bragging to their investors about. This isn't a new problem, of course. Companies have been trying to addict us since the dawn of commerce. But usually they weren't so blunt about it! I mean, cigarette companies tried to deny that nicotine was even addictive for decades. Perdue paid doctors to prescribe opioids with the same denial: There is only individual human weakness, no broad addictive qualities here! Silicon Valley, on the other hand, lionizes addiction under the banner of engagement. It used to be the highest praise for a tech company to be called 'sticky', back when they also openly referred to users as 'eyeballs'. It's a little less blunt now, but barely.

Not so much because I need to precisely tell time all that often – most of my days, the calendar is pretty empty – but because they remind me that I'm going to die. That reminder of death is a reminder to make time count. Forget about productivity, though. The notion that TIME = MONEY – squandered unless invested with a great return! – is spiritually bankrupt. No, making time count in terms of spending it well. Being able to close my eyes, on the last day, with a smile of satisfaction. This is a recurring theme in Stoicism. That life is long enough if you spend it well, but spending it well requires embracing life's shortness. Which is at once morbid and liberating. That so much of what we fool ourselves into obsession over is trivial. But also that we could spend our time on things that are not trivial. We could embrace our principles, we could go the long way to take a stand. It's also a strong theme in existentialism. The absurdity of our daily lives. The rut we can't escape unless we accept that absurdity. It's for the same reason I hope we never do discover immortality. A hundred years, give or take a decade or two, is enough. The constraint is part of what gives the duration its meaning. But, you know, watches are also just fun. They're art. They're tactile. They're engineering. And right now I'm absolutely smitten by this Casio A168-WA1. It tickles all the right spots of nostalgia. Even though I never owned a Casio growing up! But the mix of fonts, colors, and just plain cool words – ELECTROLUMINESCENCE! ALARM CHRONO! ILLUMINATOR! – is as interesting to me as the mix of balance springs, wheels, plates, and rubies of a mechanical watch. It's also just a Good Watch. It's light, it's sturdy(ish), the battery lasts 7-10 years, and it's got all the complications I've ever wanted: Time, date, alarm, chrono.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/directional-decisions-22bcd41c", "title": "Directional Decisions in Product Development: The Case of Writebook", "content": "In the course of building products, you\u2019ll make a thousand common decisions, but only a handful of directional decisions. While a common decision may alter a specific feature, design, or implementation, a directional decision remaps the fundamental trajectory of the entire product. Make a directional decision and you\u2019re now pointed this way or that way. Make a directional decision and you either shut something off or open something up. Make a directional decision and you\u2019ll get a hundred no\u2019s for the price of one. Let\u2019s look at a specific directional decision we made for Writebook, our latest product. Writebook is remarkably simple software that lets you publish text and pictures in a simple, browsable online book format. Books are written and published. This presents an opportunity to make a directional decision: Is Writebook a writing tool or a publishing tool? Or both? At one point, we treated the publishing side and the writing side as equals. Both are involved in getting a book online. Seems reasonable, right? Reasonable isn\u2019t the measure, though. It\u2019s easy to say something should do everything well because saying something is easy doesn\u2019t involve any work, or require any tradeoffs. But building products is all about tradeoffs. When there are no tradeoffs in the conversation you\u2019re having, you know you aren\u2019t building, you\u2019re just talking. But it was time to build. But what\u2019s the epicenter of Writebook? What\u2019s the thing you can do easily with Writebook that was a lot harder without Writebook? Essentially, what does Writebook exist to do? What did the current world look like without Writebook? You can write books in a thousand tools in a thousand places. But instantly publishing a book in a simple web-friendly format is really hard. It generally involves a lot of custom work, or a complex CMS system, or bending some blogging platform into a pretzel just to unsatisfyingly make it sorta kinda create books instead of blogs. And since Writebook supports Markdown, you can easily write in a simple text editor and then copy and paste the finished text into Writebook when you\u2019re ready. The place to write isn\u2019t what\u2019s lacking out there. The place to publish is. So we made a directional decision: Writebook was a publishing tool. You could obviously still write in it \u2014 we even designed a new Markdown editor to make basic formatting easier. But, our overall directional deciding Writebook was about publishing rather than writing allowed us to say no to dozens of days of additional work and sidestep piles of additional complexity. But how did that decision come to be? Why did it happen? When did it happen? Well, before we settled on the publishing angle, we went down the \u201cwriting and publishing are equals\u201d path. Part of that project involved building a system to track diffs so an author (or multiple) could track changes, additions, and subtractions. Writing software usually has this sort of thing, so if we were making writing software it felt like basic table stakes. It was during a design review that it hit me. This is fucking complicated and unnecessary. It\u2019ll work, but it\u2019s not actually useful. And, further, trying to build a multiple-author change tracking system to our standards is going to distract us from the more important, core differentiation work we have to do on the publishing side. Workbook is a final publishing platform, it's not a collaborative editing environment. What we're solving for is easily getting a book up online, in in various formats, in the simplest, quickest, more comprehensive way. If you want comprehensive collaborative editing and change tracking, write it elsewhere and, when it's done, pop it in here to publish. We ended up keeping a very minimal version of writing history in place as a backstop for major mistakes (\u201cOh shit, I deleted the whole thing by accident\u201d), but in the final version of Writebook there\u2019s no formal track changes feature, no colored diffs, and no focus on the collaborative writing process. Writebook is simply a final publishing platform first and foremost. You can write and edit in it, but it\u2019s bare bones and basic \u2014 which is fine almost all of the time anyway. And guess what? Writebook has been out for a few weeks now and tracking changes or sophisticated collaborative editing tools or features has barely been requested. I\u2019m glad we explored it early on, but even more glad we dropped it in the end. Publishing was the right direction. -Jason About Jason Fried Hey!

And individual blog posts on a number of other platforms. These are solved problems. But it's surprisingly challenging to publish books on the web in nice, cohesive, tight, easy-to-navigate HTML format. A collection of 20 essays can be a book. Or a company's handbook can be a book. Or an actual book like Shape Up can be a book. But usually you have to make a custom web site, or stretch to use a blog publishing/CMS tool to kinda-sorta squish separate posts together into a packaged whole. It's really not ideal. We know \u2014 we've published a variety of books online, and we've had to go the custom route each time.

A collection of 20 essays can be a book. Or a company's handbook can be a book. Or an actual book like Shape Up can be a book. But usually you have to make a custom web site, or stretch to use a blog publishing/CMS tool to kinda-sorta squish separate posts together into a packaged whole. It's really not ideal.

Yet, it\u2019s especially pervasive in entrepreneurial circles. It\u2019s almost as if failure has been fetishized. Nearly worshipped as a right of passage, a prerequisite, a required step on the way. I\u2019m not here to say everything works out. Most things don\u2019t. Plenty of things I\u2019ve poured time and attention into never went anywhere. It can be disappointing. And, depending on what went into it, and what you're left with, it can put you in a perilous spot. But, for your own good, it\u2019s best to relativize things like this \u2014 especially when the odds are perpetually, and naturally, stacked against you. Collecting losses, and becoming a connoisseur of catastrophe, won\u2019t help you get a win next time around. So, what instead? For me, it\u2019s a simple shift. I\u2019ve always just felt that some stuff works out better than other stuff. I think that\u2019s the healthiest way to think about it. Just a drop of relative recognition is all it deserves. I also don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find that many lessons looking back on what didn\u2019t work. You probably don\u2019t really know why it didn\u2019t work anyway. It feels good to imagine you do, but there isn\u2019t a long history of people doing the same thing again, swapping this one wrong thing for another presumed right thing, and turning it all around. But if it was so easy to see what went wrong on reflection, shouldn\u2019t there be turnaround stories everywhere you look? More likely, it a swirling confluence of decisions, ideas, events, timing, conditions, and serendipity that drove it off the map. It\u2019s easy to reflect comfortably on convenient assumptions about the past, but real reasons happen in present conditions. So yeah, some stuff works out better than others. That means some stuff doesn\u2019t work at all. But it\u2019s not a failure, and it doesn\u2019t need a name. It just didn\u2019t pan out as you hoped. Move on, look forward, learn by doing and not reviewing, and get on with it.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/look-back-less-848e9db0", "title": "A Better Path Forward", "content": "One of the reasons companies have a hard time moving forward is because they've tangled themselves in the near past. Eyes aimed backwards rather than ahead, staring at the dark, feet in their own concrete. They've trapped themselves looking for certainty where there isn't any. Searching for actionable advice where there are only guesses. Something sorta went wrong. A project didn't go as planned. Some launch didn't meet expectations. A number someone felt was in reach didn't get hit. So they look back, scanning the ruins for something shiny. They gather people up and call for a search party. They launch into post-mortems and retrospectives. It's a mistake most of the time. And a waste of time almost all of the time. Let's start with when it makes sense. If the process is highly mechanized, isolated, or systematized, then you can look back and find the exact moment when something went wrong. And you don't need to conjure up a \"what if\" counterfactual, you know for sure this was the point of failure. For example, if you're making widgets, and your small circular disks are coming out as half moons instead, then you can trace the process back, figure out where the stamping went wrong, correct that machine or process, and absolutely 100% fix the issue. If you can do that, by all means do that. Technical downtime can often be perfectly traced like that, too. But so many failed projects subject to retrospectives are searching for reasons where there are only humans to be found. Ever been on one that lasts hours only to determine \"next time we need to communicate better\"? I bet you have. Or one that says \"If we only would have involved QA earlier we would have caught that.\" Or \"Next time we need to be more careful to take seasonal timing into account\". Or \"designers and programmers need to work more closely together.\" Or some other generalized platitude, extruded from the retrospective process. There may be truth in the statements, but are they really the reason things didn't go as planned? Really? You sure? And those aren't actually answers, they remain questions without question marks. So now what, specifically? Spending hours of people's time grabbing for something grippy in the box of generalized excuses isn't going to turn up a treasure. And most of the time, reasons are actually mysteries. Or deeper than you can dig. Or too many to count. The world, the work, the market, the customer, the timing, the pressure, the economy at large, the expectations, the hopes and dreams are fuzzy, abstract, and irrational. You can point, but not at a point that's clearly defined enough to make a difference next time. Counterfactuals are deeply satisfying because they can never be proven. They never have to smash into reality. Imagination takes hold, a scapegoat comes into focus, and we can blame it all on the thing we'll never know mattered in the first place. Report written, meeting adjourned! A better path is to reflect forward, not backwards. Develop a loose theory while working on what's next. Appreciate there's no certainty to be found, and put all your energy into doing better on an upcoming project. But how will you do better next time if you don't know what went wrong last time? Nothing is guaranteed other than experience. You'll simply have more time under the curve, and more moments under tension, to perform better moving forward. Internalize as you go, not as you went. If you're any good, you'll simply do better next time because you're better at what you do than you were the last time you did it. That may be murky and unsatisfying for some, but I believe it to be absolutely true. So next time the involuntary instinct kicks in, and the urge to schedule a retro when something didn't go as planned, skip it and skip ahead. There's more to learn looking forward. -Jason", "date": "2023-11-03T00:00:00", "id": "61f1fab1-032b-4d33-a957-2d6a340d6a20", "author": "jason"}

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/teaching-iteration-2787a665", "title": "The Writing Class I'd Like to Teach", "content": "I\u2019ve written about [the class I\u2019d like to teach](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-writing-class-id-like-to-teach-11b259f44a5d), but what I\u2019ve been thinking about lately is the class I\u2019d like to attend. Not necessarily now, but when I was growing up. In the 6th grade, let\u2019s say.I don\u2019t know why people ask me this, but I\u2019m often polled for my opinion on the American education system. What\u2019s my take? What would I do to fix it? I don\u2019t know, really. \u201cIt\u201d covers too much ground to be addressed accurately. Education is delivered at every scale, from an individual reading a book, to a 1:1 tutor, to a small home/classroom setting, to a larger university auditorium-sized class, to online classes that can be theoretically taken by the entire planet at once. From one to 8 billion. You can\u2019t fix anything that\u2019s so big and so varied. You can, however, fix small parts of things. And hopefully, as the small, fixed parts add up, you have a chance at chipping away at a big problem. So here\u2019s my one small idea: I\u2019d begin to teach *iteration*. Iteration as a subject, equivalient to math, science, history, language, art, music, etc. How do you make something better over time? How do you return to something that you\u2019ve done and see it with fresh eyes? How do you apply new perspective to an old problem? Where do you find that new perspective? What trails do you follow and which do you ignore? How do you smash the familiar and reassemble something new from the same pieces?Once you\u2019re done with school, and cast out into the world, your job is likely to involve iteration. No matter what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re probably going to have to do something over. And often times again and again. You rarely simply deliver something and move on. You\u2019re asked to refactor, to build on it, to \u201cmake it better\u201d. Making anything better is iteration. When you put something out there, it\u2019ll often land right back in your lap. Sometimes that feedback boomerangs back directly, other times you have to infer the problems by disciphering other people\u2019s behavior when they interact with the thing you gave them. This customer struggled with this, this manufacturing tolerance didn\u2019t line up with that, this printing process looked better on the screen than it did on paper. Or after a certain amount of time passes while working on something, you reflect on what you\u2019ve done and don\u2019t like the reflection. Either way, someone\u2019s probably going to ask you to take the state of *your*art, and make it the state of*the*art.Now that you\u2019ve got it back, what do you do with it? This is something you have to learn how to deal with. But in school \u2014 save for writing a few drafts before handing in the final version \u2014 you don\u2019t get to iterate much. You move on from assignment to assignment, rarely getting a chance to revisit your work earlier in the semester. I think that\u2019s a missed opportunity. So, perhaps for a final assignment (no matter the subject), students should be able to choose something they did earlier in the year and get a chance to improve on it. Make version 2. I think working on four things, and getting a chance to redo one of them would be more valuable than working on five separate things. It would be a better education. Or another take would be a single assignment for the entire semester. Every two weeks you hand in a new version of it. In time you may slam into diminishing returns, but that\u2019s all part of it too. That would be a better education. Or maybe you work on something and hand it in. Then the teacher shuffles the deck, so to speak, and hands you back someone else\u2019s assignment. Now you have two weeks to improve on that. And that cycle \u2014 improving on someone else\u2019s work \u2014 continues for the whole semester. That would closely mirror what work on the outside is really like. That would be a better education. I don\u2019t know, something like that. So there, I guess that\u2019s my initial idea to improve the educational system. Teach problem solving through iteration. Bounce things back to people for a second or third try. And then a fourth and a fifth. And so on. Require them to bring new perspectives. Demonstrate how time, space, and chance are on your side \u2014 they give you the opportunity to wander around with an idea and take it in new directions. Iteration is evolution. Hopefully what\u2019s next is better than what came before it. -Jason", "date": "2023-10-13T00:00:00", "id": "e2c9a095-d8ba-4e3a-9a70-0155be1c102e", "author": "jason"}

That could require a migration, which would require especially careful testing and staging ahead of a major deploy. The other sticking point is that Basecamp allows each customer to rename their tools inside a project, or even the default set of tools applied to all projects. So it's possible that some of their Campfire's were renamed to other things like 'Group chat' or 'Chatter' or 'Talk' or 'The Watercooler' or whatever else felt natural to them. So not every Campfire is called Campfire. The hard thing to do would be to automate the process by going through every project and changing any Campfires named exactly 'Campfire' to 'Chat' instead, and then leaving the rest as is. But we also have foreign language conditions \u2014 someone may have named their Campfire 'Fogata' (which is Campfire in Spanish). Do we change those too? If we're out to be accurate and consistent yes. But no. We don't do any of that. Doing that would be hard. And unnecessary. And time consuming. And potentially error prone. All sorts of things could go wrong \u2014 or right \u2014 but whatever the outcome, it's entirely unnecessary work to begin with. So we won't do it. We'll simply do this: Moving forward, all new projects have their chat tool called Chat, and all existing projects stay exactly as they were, whatever they were. Consistency is not important here, context is. Let old things be, let new things be different. This sidesteps the extra work, extra testing, conversion complications, and potential for errors. Does that mean some older projects will have Campfires while some newer projects will have Chats? Even on the same account? Sure does. And that's just fine. It doesn't matter, and in time it'll fade away anyway as more new projects are created than old projects exist.

Culture simply happens. It's emergent behavior. There's nothing to do, it just is. A company's culture is a 50-day moving average. It's what you've been collectively doing as a company over the last 50 days. How do you treat people? Who have you hired (or fired) and why? What do you when people are stressed out? How do you help people? How do you critique each other? How do you share? How do you help people who are stuck? Where's the bar on quality? How do you support customers? How do you close deals? What have you let go on too long? What have you celebrated? What have you let slide? How honest have you been with each other and yourself. It's all that and a zillion other things. But it's all stuff that actually happened, it's not lists of things you wish had happened, or declared would happen in some ideal setting. Much of it is interpersonal, expressed both inside and outside the organization. Why 50 days? It's enough time for patterns to emerge, yet malleable enough to be current and honest. One day, or even a couple weeks, isn't enough to stand for culture. A series of moments tied together loosely by near-term time just isn't enough to establish what it's really like somewhere. We can all be on our best behavior for a little while, but the longer while tells the truth. Culture is the non-fiction story of an organization. It writes itself. -Jason", "date": "2023-09-12T00:00:00", "id": "1c3d6ef2-835d-42b8-8313-44c590673e30", "author": "jason"}

Charging credit cards wasn't easy in the early 2000s. This was back when being an 'internet company' was a major red flag. The process required mounds of paperwork, proof, and business model scrutiny just to get approved. Barely capable, ancient APIs sorta kinda let you hook into internal systems. Charging a card successfully felt like a miracle. You had no idea. It wasn't years later until companies like Stripe made it simple. While you were never really happy with the service, you had to have it. And switching to another service meant going through the whole ungainly process again. And the grass was probably browner. However, one day a fellow named Bryan Johnson reached out. He started a company called Braintree that processed credit cards. I can't remember exactly what made them different, although they certainly felt more 'modern'. Their API looked like it had been written recently, rather than back in the 80s like JP Morgan's. But more than that, we liked Bryan. He was clearly competent, he was local, he wasn't afraid of the internet, he was aware of what we did, what we were trying to do, and who we were. He wasn't a sales guy trying to close a deal, he was a CEO trying to build his own business. That meant something to us. So we gave them our business. And nearly two decades later, we're still with them today. And Bryan didn't just close the deal and move on, he remained our point of contact for years. He was always reasonably available, and would always be willing to dig into an issue if something went wrong. We had his direct cell and his email. He felt like he was on our side. This whole experience made a major impression on me. It made me really appreciate who we did business with. And even in my personal life, who I do business with. Can I reach the owner? Can I email the CEO? Who's over there working for me, vs. just selling me and moving on? This is one of the reasons I really value doing business with smaller businesses. Typically founder-led, or owner-involved companies. Companies that may have structure, but they'll part it like the Red Sea when a customer needs access to the top. It's also why I make sure I'm accessible to all our customers. I even include my email address \u2014 work and personal \u2014 in different places when new customers sign up.

We\u2019ve always wanted customers to judge the product they could buy and use today, not some imaginary version that might exist in the future. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve never committed to a product road map. It\u2019s not because we have a secret one in the back of some smoky room we don\u2019t want to share, but because one doesn\u2019t actually exist.

But when we recently launched an See, a new version didn\u2019t initially include a feature our customers were clamoring for: Project templates. The requests piled in, the emails piled up. We wanted to do it, but we weren\u2019t sure when we\u2019d be able to get to it. So we just told people \u201cby the end of the year.\u201d At the time that gave us eight months or so\u2014which sounded easy\u2014but it discounted all the work it would take to get it done as well as all the other stuff we also had to do at the same time. March ticked by. Then April. Then May, June, July, and August. We still hadn\u2019t started on the project templates feature. And then September and October arrived, and now, to come through on our promise, we had to drop a bunch of other things we wanted to do so that we could deliver project templates before the year ended. It was a great feature, and customers ultimately loved it, but we had to rush it. That\u2019s what promises lead to\u2014rushing, dropping, scrambling, and a tinge of regret at the earlier promise that was a bit too easy to make. Promises pile up like debt, and they accrue interest, too. The longer you wait to fulfill them, the more they cost to pay off and the worse the regret. When it\u2019s time to do the work, you realize just how expensive that yes really was. Many companies are weighed down by all sorts of prior obligations to placate.

If advice on how to run your company isn't coming at you 280 characters at a time on Twitter, you can hear it on a podcast, read it on a Substack, or get it right here on your LinkedIn feed. There's hardly a CEO, an entrepreneur, or a cultural figure these days who doesn't profess to hold some wisdom that will lead you to building a great business. I don't think this proliferation of expertise is a particularly useful development. It's overwhelming and often contradicting. It's hard to know what's worth knowing when you don't know in the first place. So rather than give you advice on how to take advice, I thought I'd share my personal approach to filtering it. Whenever I get advice, I first find out if the person giving it has ever done the thing being suggested. There are plenty of gurus out there telling you how to start a business who have never started one themselves, like business school professors who have spent their careers in academia. Or marketing experts that haven't marketed anything at scale for a decade (or ever). Or ChatGPT experts telling you how game changing something is when the game barely started. If they haven't done the thing, I dismiss the advice. I don't want theory. I want practice. If they have done the thing, then I find out when they did it. Was it years ago? Are they still doing it as they describe? I believe advice has an expiration date. For example, I'm the wrong person to ask about starting a business. Why? I haven't started one for 24 years. You're far better off asking someone who started a business six months ago. Then, if they have done it, and they still are doing it, it's good to know for how long. I put more weight into someone's advice if that person has been following it for an extended time. Another thing I consider is the motivation behind the advice. Is someone with experience trying to sell you something? If so, discount that advice. If it's in the service of sharing and mentoring, and there's no commercial connection, invest in that advice. Last, I tend to look at how much advice a person gives. If someone is a professional advice giver \u2014 writing book after book in quick succession \u2014 I'll take what they have to say with a grain of salt. It's hard to be good at one thing, let alone dozens of things. Here's the most important thing to recognize about advice: It's relative. It's contextual. People love to share success stories, and suggest you follow in their footsteps, but most people really have no idea how they achieved what they achieved. They look back and connect dots that maybe weren't there, lay it out for you, and encourage you to do the same thing. That's why you should ignore more advice than you take. Find your own way. Then, once you've been doing it long enough, maybe you can share your lessons with others \u2014 and they can decide whether that's worth listening to.

The other vision is about immersion. One vision is natural and understands you. The other vision requires new methods of interaction that you have to learn and master. One vision feels like an assist. One vision feels like obstruction. One vision fits with whatever you already have. One vision requires you buy something that fits. One vision is simply text.

But the smartest businesses \u2014 the ones that tend to stick around for the long haul \u2014 know that existence is also about avoidance. Avoiding careening variable costs, avoiding getting involved with things that aren't core to your business, avoiding spending time on things that don't matter, avoiding bad investments, avoiding people who don't help you prosper, and even avoiding customers who aren't the right fit.

Avoiding overkill is the real cheat code. That's how you jump levels. It's how you make a lot more progress with a lot less effort. Overkill is the dust that settles on the stuff that took a lot of energy to build or buy, but turned out not to be necessary. The over-engineered, over-designed, over-hired, over-litigated, the over-spent, over-promised, over-deliberated. Overkill is the policy that was written but never enacted. The technology that was purchased that was never used. The seven steps that could be handled in two. The nine people in a meeting made for three. The business equivalent of the 12 bedroom house for a family of four. The cooks when you don't even have a kitchen. Overkill is using five different products to run a single project. Overkill is an seven-stage interview process that exhausts everyone involved. Overkill is acting like a company 100x your size. Overkill is buying what they bought but that you don't need. Overkill is paying thousands for something worth hundreds. Overkill is hoping that losing more will turn into a win. In our 24 years, there's nothing we've tried to avoid more at 37signals than overkill. In the things we do, in the way we work, in the things we buy, in the things we use.

And when I do it, I spot it and correct for it. I\u2019d say I\u2019m 90% better. Lately I\u2019ve been using another tool to help create some space before I form an opinion. It\u2019s a simple word called \u201cyet\u201d. Over the past years I\u2019ve found a lot of joy in things I\u2019d normally have dismissed. And it\u2019s all because of \u201cyet\u201d. Instead of \u201cI don\u2019t like that color\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t like that color\u2026 yet\u201d.

What I\u2019ve found is obvious: You don\u2019t need to have an opinion on everything. Instead, just be open. Let it settle in. Get used to it. Give it a chance. And then you\u2019ll know. Or not! It\u2019s ok not to know where you stand on something. It\u2019s actually a lot more interesting. There\u2019s so much freedom in not having an opinion yet (or ever). Minds are expected to be made up these days. In a flash, no less. No thanks. I\u2019ll just let it roll around for a while with no deadline. There\u2019s no rush, and very little benefit to rush to judgement. You just might find, as I have, that there\u2019s a lot more to like and discover and revel in when you simply allow yourself to wait. Bask in the maybe for a while. This is different than indecision. When decisions do need to be made, I make them. But many things in life don\u2019t need decisions \u2014 they\u2019re just experiences.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/on-hiring-rehiring-and-one-question-to-answer-them-all-5db97bcb", "title": "The Second Hire: A Crucial Moment in Hiring", "content": "Out of all things I\u2019m asked about, hiring tops the list. From the actual hiring process, to reviews, to motivation and retention strategies, curiosity about hiring is on full charge. There\u2019s a lot to cover, but I\u2019d like to share some thoughts about a moment that doesn\u2019t get enough attention: The end of the first year and the beginning of the second. Hiring is typically thought of as something you do once per person. Once someone\u2019s hired, training, growing, and retaining are the next things you do. You may keep training someone, you may keep growing someone, you may keep promoting someone, but you surely don\u2019t keep hiring someone. It\u2019s on that point I disagree. I\u2019ve found that, actually, you hire someone at least twice. You hire someone initially, and then, if all goes well, you hire them again 12 months later. That second hire is the crucial hire, even though it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say you continually hire someone throughout their career. Framing it like this simplifies a lot. And the simplification isn\u2019t for convenience, it\u2019s for clarity. Deep, cutting, crystal clarity. Yes, managers and team leads here check in with people as they get going, 90 days in, 6 months in, and as-needed 1:1s along the way. And since leadership here is very hands on, everyone collides with each other\u2019s work. At 37signals, it\u2019s actually easier to know how someone\u2019s doing than not. And it\u2019s in that first year \u2014 really those first few months \u2014 where you can tell if someone\u2019s going to work out, or we\u2019re just not right for them. This is where the magic of the second hire framing comes in. Rather than go through an extensive, artificial 12-month performance analysis process to statistically determine how someone\u2019s doing at the end of that crucial first year, we blow all that abstract blurriness away with one simple clarifying question. The manager simply asks themselves: \u201cWith a full year behind me, knowing what I know now, would I hire this person again?\u201d Because that\u2019s essentially exactly what you\u2019re doing. If you keep the person on, you\u2019re re-hiring them. Because the alternative is letting them go and hiring someone else to replace them. So you are hiring either way. So just get real about it and dive into the deliberation head first. I can\u2019t stress enough how clarifying this is. With a single insight you\u2019ve answered a dozen questions and eliminated a dozen more. Plus it annihilates all sorts of procedural acrobatics companies typically use to measure someone\u2019s performance. Instead the question is simple, and the answer is pure and true. Yes I would hire them again. Or no I would not. That is everything. A year is enough time to know. And if you don\u2019t know, the answer is almost certainly no. None of this is to say someone needs to be perfect. Few rarely are at one year, or ten! And perfection or perfect fit isn\u2019t what you\u2019re after anyway. It\u2019s someone\u2019s trajectory that\u2019s important. Great managers responsible for great teams know who\u2019d they hire again and who they wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s in that knowing where you\u2019ll find the serenity of decision. And the 12-month mark is the perfect moment to have that second chance to make that crucial call. It\u2019s through this direct method we\u2019ve hired, re-hired, and retained some of the best people in the business for years. We\u2019ve celebrated more 5, 10, and 15+ year anniversaries over our 24 years than I can remember. When the average tenure in our industry barely stretches 2 years, we\u2019re enormously proud of our record here. The results are real. And, BTW, if you\u2019re on the other side of the equation, ask yourself the same question in reverse. \u201cKnowing what I know now, would I take this job again?\u201d Because sticking around is doing exactly that \u2014 accepting the job again. I hope you find this method useful.

But don\u2019t do that. *remake*it.When evaluating a redesign, your first instinct is to compare the new design to the old design. But don\u2019t do that. The first step is to understand what you\u2019re evaluating. If you just put the new design up against the old design, and compare the two, the old design will strongly influence your evaluation of the new design. This is OK if nothing\u2019s changed since the original design was launched. But it\u2019s likely a lot has changed since then \u2013 especially if many months or years have passed. Maybe there are new insights, maybe there\u2019s new data, maybe there\u2019s a new goal, maybe there\u2019s a new hunch, or maybe there\u2019s a whole new strategy at play.

But if the old design sets the tone about what\u2019s important, then you may be losing out on an opportunity to make a significant leap forward. A design should never set the tone \u2013 ideas should set the tone. Ideas are independent of the design. So, when evaluating a redesign you have to know what you\u2019re looking for, not just what you\u2019re looking at. How the new design compares to the old may be the least important thing to consider.

It happens to be my title too. I've come to believe it's an impossible title. You're either CEO, or you're Founder. You can't hold both full-time jobs. And unless your company is probably 100+, CEO isn't really a job anyway. It's more of a role someone needs to play occasionally. There simply aren't that many big picture things or decisions to \"execute\" day in and day out \u2014 or even week in and week out \u2014 to make it a true full time job. A role yes, a hat to wear yes, a full-time job at a smallish company? No. It's part-time at best, quarter-time even better. Further, the fundamental responsibilities of Founders and CEOs are at odds. Having them mashed up in the same title is as ridiculous as having someone who's a \"CTO & Chief Luddite\". Why's that? Because a Founder's job is injecting risk into the business. It's flooding it with new ideas, stuff that seems hard to do, ideas that no one else would dare try, placing the kinds of bets that only someone who started the damn thing would be willing to wager. A Founders' job is basically to stay in business by almost always putting it out of business. A CEO's job? Just about the opposite. It's reducing risk, executing diligently to achieve obvious goals, staying in business at all costs. It's primarily about about being conservative, keeping the company's collective cool, and not letting things get out of hand. Just about everything that a Founder isn't doing. A CEO's job is to stay in business by not allowing the company to do anything so stupid that it could go out of business. See? They're such different things. The minds powering the pistons run on different fuel. But I get it. It's a wonderful boost to the ego to hold the top two jobs in a company \u2014 especially when the original sin of starting the damn thing was your decision.

Your skeleton key fits both locks. Founder is a unique position as it's the one job that can't be replaced. It can be eliminated, certainly, as many companies go founder-free after some time. But once the person who started it isn't there, you can't bring someone else in who started it. The closest thing then becomes a CEO. So I've shifted my personal thinking. As long as I'm still here, I'm picking a side. I'm a Founder. That's my strength, that's where I can bring the most. Which means we don't really have a full-time CEO.

How do you encourage innovative thinking at work?\" My answer: You don't stay innovative and you don't encourage innovative thinking at work. WHAT? Yes. Innovation should almost never happen. It's incredibly rare. It mostly happens by accident, not by intention. It's wonderful when it does, but you merely fluctuate in and out of it, it's not steady state. Work is mostly mundane. It's mostly maintenance. It's mostly local improvement and iteration. Work is mostly... Work. Any innovation is an outlier, nearly a rounding error. Even the most innovative projects or products are full of rote, prosaic stuff that still needs building. The poetic magic may be in the 5%, but the bulk of the work is in the other 95. So I told the students they'd better get used to that. Work is not often very exciting, but it can absolutely be fulfilling. And you can be excited about that. But if you're expecting breakthroughs all the time, riff sessions that constantly lead somewhere new, or brainstorms that shoot lightning, you're going to be disappointed. Yes innovation happens.

He was overwhelmed by a home renovation project that ballooned in size. What started as a simple kitchen countertop replacement turned into more work in the kitchen, new lighting throughout the house, a master bathroom gut rehab, and new flooring in every room. It became too much. He felt like he was sinking and he couldn't find a grip to grab to prevent the downward spiral. This was his first time managing so many things at once, along with living with the mess that's inherent to demolition. Calm was hard to find, and clarity had left the building. With genuine concern distorting his voice, he said \"I'm in a bad spot. What do I do?\" So I asked him to give me a rundown on what was finished, and what was in progress. Essentially, step one is simply taking inventory. And that's where the problem became clear. What happened with his project is what happens with many projects, personal or work. Companies, in particular, are perpetually plagued by this problem: Too much unfinished business all at once. None of the projects in my friend's house were done. Everything was in progress. The kitchen countertops weren't done yet. The backsplash was halfway there. The lights were about 80% done. Some of the floors were ripped up, while more remained to demo. The master bath was half torn apart. And so on. Nothing done, everything started. Guys were jumping around between this and that, trying to make progress on the whole thing without finishing anything. Now, that might be OK if the initial crew was really large, and each project was being done by separate dedicated teams. But in this case, the contractor had a crew of three doing all the work, and a client piling on more projects as they went. So here are the clear instructions I gave: What started as a simple kitchen countertop replacement turned into more work in the kitchen, new lighting throughout the house, a master bathroom gut rehab, and new flooring in every room.

So here are the clear instructions I gave: \\- Stop everything. \\- Take status of everything. Where does each project broadly stand in terms of size, scope, completion, and unknowns. \\- Pick a smaller project that's almost done, and redirect all resources to finishing that one up before working on anything else. Get something finished. Establish \"completion discipline\". \\- Only move on to the next project once the current project is 100% done. \\- Do not add to the pile. No more new projects. There are subdivisions in the steps too. You can consider if what's open needs closing, what's doing needs to be done. But those are nuanced decisions that can easily trap you in indecision. The best process in this case is one that's easy to grasp and do: **Stop, status, selection, focus, finish, next.** This isn't about calling in reinforcements or adding more resources. This is about stopping, slowing down, eliminating the spread of attention, honing in, and driving to completion. Two days later, my friend calls me back. \"It's night night and day. The kitchen countertops are done, the backsplash in in progress and will be done end of day. Next we're moving to the master bathroom. It all feels under control again.\" The house is still a mess. That's the nature of construction. But at least his mind is clear, and the path ahead is obvious to everyone. Project management isn't just about guiding things down the perfect golden path. It can be about rescuing stuff that's gone off the rails. As much as we'd all like to avoid it, it does us no good to avoid admitting that it's often required. Rescue and repair is part of the natural cycle, and the better you get at it, the more progress you'll ultimately make. -Jason", "date": "2023-04-11T00:00:00", "id": "981d2fd4-2f02-472c-ad24-80322703eabe", "author": "jason"}

So that's how responses come in, as replies. None of that is frustrating. I love hearing from readers. Some of the replies I get are detailed, personal accounts relating to something I said. And with those, I typically take the time to write commensurate replies. But many of the replies I get are simple gestures of thanks. \"Thanks for that \u2014 really enjoyed the read\" or \"That one really resonated, thanks\" or \"I appreciate that you took the time to write that up.\" Stuff like that. Or, as often happens, I'll have a typo in my original post and 27 people reply to let me know. I wrote, they replied, and I feel like I should thank them back. But here's the reality: As I've amassed a larger number of subscribers, I've been getting a larger number of simple thank you emails. Again \u2014 it's lovely, I appreciate them. But it's become more time consuming to reply in kind with a \"no, thank YOU\" (or \"you're welcome, thanks for subscribing to the newsletter\") to their thank you. It got to the point where I stopped replying to people because I didn't want to write 24 separate emails basically saying the same thing. It became too time consuming, yet I still felt people deserved replies. So I started to feel a bit guilty. But I didn't start writing to feel guilty, so... What to do? What I wanted to do was send a single, kind reply to 24 people at once. But I didn't want to gather up their emails and do some strange BCC thing. That's also a hassle, and BCC's feel spammy. Now, I know I'm not the only one who runs into these sorts of situations. There are a number of scenarios where you may want to write the same thing to a collection of people in individual emails. Maybe you had 8 bills to pay, which you paid, and you wanted to let those 8 people know \"Just paid, you should see the payment hit your account within 24 hours.\" Or maybe a dozen people write you separate \"Welcome back from your trip!\" emails, and you want to reply with a single email with some pictures, links, some notes from the trip. I'm sure you've run into similar situations in your own email lives. Wouldn't it be useful to write once, send many? Without cc, bcc, or some complicated concatenation of email addresses from different people who shouldn't know each other? Yes, it should be!

If you're not using HEY yet, now's the perfect time to dive in and take back control of your email, your time, and your attention. *simply useful*.Yesterday we shipped a feature in HEY called \" [Reply to Everyone](https://updates.37signals.com/post/new-in-hey-reply-to-everyone)\" that was exactly that: Simply useful.One of the things that makes something simply useful is a clear line from problem to solution. From hassle to effortlessness. From a lot of time to nearly no time at all. From creating work to eliminating work. So let's trace Reply to Everyone back to the initial germ of the idea. It all started with frustration. This is a great place to start any feature. In fact, the closer you start to frustration, the more fuel you have to burn up the problem. What was frustrating? Well, I write a fair bit on my personal HEY World blog. That's where this exact post is hosted, and I have close to 10,000 subscribers who receive the posts via email. And whenever I write, I typically get a heavy handful of people who write me back. HEY World blogs don't have comments, they simply have replies, like any other email. So that's how responses come in, as replies. None of that is frustrating. I love hearing from readers. Some of the replies I get are detailed, personal accounts relating to something I said.

He was frustrated with an employee who kept asking him what to do if x, y, or z happens. This was a long-time employee who'd been in these situations before, not someone new who was learning the ropes. With this particular employee, it's always the same set of questions no matter the situation. It could be a call with a client. If could be a meeting with another department. It could be a conversation with a vendor. What if they bring this up...? What if they bring that up...? What should I say if they say...? What about if they...? Essentially this employee wanted to be prepared for every contingency in a given situation. And they were great when everything went as anticipated. Being prepared sounds like a good idea, and you could understand why they might ask these questions. Considering the edge cases ahead of time is certainly useful. You might read the above and say 'Yeah, and? What's wrong with that?' There are many ways to prepare for any eventuality, and one of them is to literally prepare for all possible outcomes. But another one, and I'd say the more valuable \u2014 and useful \u2014 one is to become comfortable with the unknown. To develop on instinct around dealing with the situation whatever comes up. To know, not just to say. More jazz, less rock. More improv, less script.

The degrees of freedom you get with someone whose ability to work with 'let's see what they say' vs. 'what if they say?' are immeasurable. To be clear, there's nothing wrong with asking questions about things that could happen. Preparation is essential regardless. And if you can know every move ahead of time, knowing every counter move might be the way to go. But in the murky realm of people and motivations and strategy and incentives, trying to map it all out will lead to you more blindspots, not less.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/delegating-projects-not-tasks-f36cb8bc", "title": "Delegating Projects vs Tasks: Transitioning to Ownership", "content": "We recently received this email from a [REWORK Podcast](https://37signals.com/podcast/) listener who had a question......I think it was in[Shape Up] that the idea of delegating projects rather than tasks came up. And I'm trying to move this way, of working with my own team. I just wonder if you guys have any tips or help for making that transition, helping team members take ownership for their areas of work, maybe obstacles I can watch out for leading my team in this way as we move in this direction. We have a small team, just a handful of people. But I would love to move in this direction where they're taking more ownership and I can delegate whole projects rather than, um, me kind of owning the project and then delegating tasks... We're likely going to address this question out loud on an upcoming podcast AMA, but I wanted to write up a response as well. So here goes. When we ultimately decide what to work on over the next [6-week cycle](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01#six-week-cycles), we assign specific projects to specific [teams of two](https://world.hey.com/jason/just- the-two-of-us-afb2f54e). And that's the last assigning, or delegating, we do on that project. Once a team of two (one programmer and one designer) is assigned to a project, *they* determine how to approach it, *they* determine the steps they're going to take, *they* determine the tasks they need to complete to get it done. *They* fill up the Card Table or To-Do Lists in their respective Basecamp project. They, they, they. Projects start with a name, the people involved, and, typically, a kickoff message describing the project in a few hundred words. But that's it. The rest starts blank and its on them to fill it in as they go. That's the other thing \u2014 a project may start with a small handful of tasks on day one, two, or three. Work is added as the project progresses, as more discoveries about the work are made. Things make the list as they need to, not in anticipation of being needed. No one defines all the work up front. That's a fools errand. Assuming you know too much up front is the best way to find out you're wrong in the end. Instead we define the direction, the purpose, the reason, and a few specific \"must haves\" up front. The rest \u2014 all the rest, which is mostly everything \u2014 is determined during the project, by the people on the project. Day three may have 12 open to-dos. But by day 14, there might be 20. And by day 15, there may be 30. Eventually that number begins to dwindle as scopes are completed, and work wraps up. As that team thinks things through, sometimes they'll make to-dos for each other since they know who will be responsible for which parts of the project. They're on the ground, they know best. But there's no one outside the project making to- dos for them, assigning them work, or otherwise telling them what to do. In other words, you don't show up waiting to be told what to do, you do what you determine needs to be done. That's how they own the outcome. They aren't responsible for determining if the feature was a good idea to build in the first place, but they do own if it works as-built. This can come to a shock to some people \u2014 especially new employees that come from more traditional organizations where their manager effectively gives them a list of tasks or goals or whatever every day. \"Here's your 12 things to get done today.\" That's not how we work. Here it's \"Here's the stuff I've decided to work on today to make progress on the project we're working on together.\" Along the way other people can check in, or be pulled in for advice, review, a second opinion, etc. But that demand is primarily driven by the teams themselves. Sometimes if we haven't noticed enough progress, or sensed something's stuck in the mud, we'll jump in, poke around, and see if we can help, but most of the time, outside assistance is purely demand driven from the inside, not the outside. QA is one minor exception. As a project moves on, QA floats in. And when they spot issues, they may assign those issues directly to either the designer or the programmer, depending on their determination of responsibility. Other times they just add them to the triage section of the [Card Table](https://basecamp.com/features/card-table) and the team divvies them up depending on how they see the responsibility. As for tips, I don't have many other than try this on something small and relatively inconsequential to start. But real. Don't practice real work on fake projects. Chunk off something, put a couple of people on it, define the concept you're after, and let them loose on it. You may need to try this a few times to get the hang of it. Your job, as the manager or team lead, is to let go. Resist the urge to define, the urge to lay out the path ahead of them. That's their job, and they'll only get better at it if you let them do it. You can do this. -Jason", "date": "2023-03-20T00:00:00", "id": "b5706cd1-a9cb-45f2-b183-cc1c832dda8c", "author": "jason"}
{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/just-the-two-of-us-afb2f54e", "title": "The Power of Two: Why Small Teams Are More Efficient", "content": "There's a lot of talk right now about smaller, slimmer, tighter teams. Economics are forcing companies to cut back, and what they're finding is progress. Trim the overgrown crown, let the sunshine meet the ground, and all sorts of new life blooms on the forest floor. Even Zuck, master of a megacorp, is noticing it: Even Zuck, master of a megacorp, is noticing it: \"Since we reduced our workforce last year, one surprising result is that many things have gone faster... Indirect costs compound and it\u2019s easy to underestimate them... A leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster\" A number of years ago I wrote a piece lauding the number three. I meant every word. Three person teams are incredibly efficient. But what's better than three? Two. Over the past few years, the number of people who work here has continued to grow, but we've downsized our product teams from three to two. At 37signals, both Basecamp and HEY are built by multiple teams of two using our Shape Up process. No feature takes more than 6 weeks to build, and each feature is assigned a maximum of two people: one designer and one programmer. And in more than a few cases, it may just be one person. How can we build so much software in such a short amount of time with tiny teams of two? That's how. If it takes more than two people, it can't. We won't let it. We'll clear it up, simplify it down, make more tradeoffs, find more elegance. If it can't fit into two, it's not ready to do. That's the discipline, and it all has to start there. Two people. This starts at hiring, of course, but it goes back further. It starts with desire: The desire to move real quality very quickly out the door to customers. And not to get caught in the corporate quicksand that swallows so many organizations whole. Big teams not only slow shit down, they expand the surface area of discontent. Talk to any large team, and you can feel the heat of frustration radiating outward. A similar heat radiates down from management \u2014 frustrated by the lack of progress. Just like work expands to fill the time available, work expands to fill the team available. Small, short projects become bigger, longer projects simply because all those people need something to do. Small is not less than. It\u2019s greater than. It\u2019s faster than. It\u2019s better than. We're often changing how we work at 37signals, but I feel like this one's settled on the product side. Two person teams simply can't be beat. Want to do more than two people can do? Add another two person team to to the mix on something else. That's what you do. Don't add them to what you're doing, add them to something you aren't. Four people making progress on two different features at the same time, rather than four people struggling to deliver one thing on time. I know companies will continue to miss the point here. Yes, they'll get smaller... Maybe go from 12 to 10 on a team. Or even cut a team in half to 6. But it's still way too much. Jump ahead, break your teams into teams of two. Adopt Shape Up, scope and shape your work accordingly. Work the tradeoffs, get good at spotting the essentials. Get tight. Then you'll see what you can really do. Get two it.", "date": "2023-03-15T00:00:00", "id": "f8eff565-db41-42bd-bdfe-4649afc6913e", "author": "jason"}

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/the-new-normal-5147c584", "title": "The New Normal", "content": "Normal comes on quick. First it starts as an outlier. Some behavior you don't love, but tolerate. Then someone else follows suit, but either you miss it or you let it slide. Then people pile on \u2014 repeating what they've seen because no one stepped in to course correct. Then it's too late. It's become the culture. The new normal. This happens in organizations all the time. A single snarky remark can cascade into a storm of collective snark in the same way a single spark can ignite a forest fire. And, implicitly, when you let it happen, it becomes okay. You're complicit in the arson. Behavior unchecked becomes behavior sanctioned. And it doesn't just have to be ugly, malicious behavior. It could be allowing poor quality out the door. Normalizing meetings for things that don't need that level of real-time attention. Pulling people off one important thing to attend to another thing less important. Designing by committee. Lowering hiring standards. Whatever you do becomes how it's done. And the higher up it's done, the more influence it loads on the structure below. We've gone down this path a number of times at 37signals. There was a time when someone working on a difficult case with a difficult customer could vent disparagingly in a company chat room, and nobody would say anything. Or we'd all rip on a company that made a mistake, forgetting that people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Or we'd ship something that wasn't good enough because we didn't want the team that worked on it to feel bad. We kinda knew it wasn't right, but we didn't stop it. Which just made it that much harder when we finally decided enough was enough. Unwinding the new normal requires far more effort than preventing the new normal from being set in the first place. If you don't want gnarly roots in your culture, you have to mind the seeds. You don't have to let something slide for long before it becomes the new normal. Culture is what culture does. Culture isn't what you intend it to be. It's not what you hope or aspire for it to be. It's what you do. So do better. And the good news is that culture is really a 50-day moving average. It's not a steady state. It's what you've done recently, what you're doing now, and what happens next. It's both along for the ride, and the ride itself. It's the byproduct of behavior. First it starts as an outlier. Some behavior you don't love, but tolerate. Then someone else follows suit, but either you miss it or you let it slide. Then people pile on \u2014 repeating what they've seen because no one stepped in to course correct. Then it's too late. It's become the culture. The new normal. This happens in organizations all the time. A single snarky remark can cascade into a storm of collective snark in the same way a single spark can ignite a forest fire. And, implicitly, when you let it happen, it becomes okay. You're complicit in the arson. Behavior unchecked becomes behavior sanctioned. And it doesn't just have to be ugly, malicious behavior. It could be allowing poor quality out the door. Normalizing meetings for things that don't need that level of real-time attention. Pulling people off one important thing to attend to another thing less important. Designing by committee. Lowering hiring standards. Whatever you do becomes how it's done. And the higher up it's done, the more influence it loads on the structure below. We've gone down this path a number of times at 37signals. There was a time when someone working on a difficult case with a difficult customer could vent disparagingly in a company chat room, and nobody would say anything. Or we'd all rip on a company that made a mistake, forgetting that people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. Or we'd ship something that wasn't good enough because we didn't want the team that worked on it to feel bad. We kinda knew it wasn't right, but we didn't stop it. Which just made it that much harder when we finally decided enough was enough. Unwinding the new normal requires far more effort than preventing the new normal from being set in the first place. If you don't want gnarly roots in your culture, you have to mind the seeds. You don't have to let something slide for long before it becomes the new normal. Culture is what culture does. Culture isn't what you intend it to be. It's not what you hope or aspire for it to be. It's what you do. So do better. And the good news is that culture is really a 50-day moving average. It's not a steady state. It's what you've done recently, what you're doing now, and what happens next. It's both along for the ride, and the ride itself. It's the byproduct of behavior. \u2014\u2014 *This essay was adapted from our book,**It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work**.*", "date": "2023-01-06T00:00:00", "id": "d3096025-ffa0-4a49-8907-8111e61a4efb", "author": "jason"}

And not just do, but do just as well \u2014 or better. Every company has different priorities of course, but let's examine a few things. With the information I was able to find online... Monday has about 1500 employees. Asana has about 1600 employees. Clickup has about 1000 employees. Slack has about 2500 employees. Smartsheet has about 3000 employees. These companies compete directly with my company, 37signals. Each of these companies has somewhere between 100-150k paying customers. Give or take a few ten thousand. And thousands more free users too. Guess what? We do too. We're right in that ballpark as well. None of these companies, us included, have an order of magnitude more customers than the other. Of course none of this is apples-to-apples, as every company is different, but we're still talking fruit. This isn't apples-to-chickens. We all offer similar kinds of products that do similar-enough things for purpose of comparison. Revenues and profits may be different, but that's a matter of business model, not the number of people served, or the quality of service. And how many employees do we have at 37signals? Around 80 (which is the most we've ever had). And are they working ridiculous all-nighters or weekends to make up for the significantly smaller team? No \u2014 we all work about 40 hours a week. What's our uptime? Exceptional. How's our customer service? Friendly, quick, and thorough. How do our customers feel about our products? Here's what 1000 have to say about Basecamp, for example. Similar story for HEY. On top of that, we also maintain two previous versions of Basecamp, Highrise, Campfire, and Backpack for thousands of customers who remain on earlier versions or older products. Building complex, large organizations is a choice, not a requirement. We chose differently. Other companies might as well. So it's absolutely possible to run a tight ship, deliver outstanding products, offer the highest level of customer service, and have exceptional uptime with a small, focused, high-quality crew working reasonable hours while living in a dozen different cities around the world. As for Twitter, I don't know what the right number is \u2014 and it's really not a number, it's about distribution and concentration. If you had 8000 people at Twitter, and they were all in sales, Twitter would be in trouble. So you obviously have to have the right people in the right places doing the right jobs, but thousands upon thousands is not a requirement simply because there were thousands upon thousands before. And I'm obviously not comparing the complexity of running a service like Twitter with Basecamp or HEY, but I do think it's very fair to compare Monday and Asana and Clickup and Slack, among others, to Basecamp and HEY. And we're able to service around the same number of customers, and actually generate more profit than all of them combined (since they're losing hundreds of millions annually, between them).

But ideas don't give a shit about any of those things. Ideas like the shower. Ideas like our pillows. Ideas like commutes. Ideas like walks. Ideas like the morning, or late nights. Ideas like daydreams. Ideas like you doing something else so they can surprise you. Ideas aren't contained. They aren't located. They don't reside. They're nomadic. They aren't something you control \u2014 they bubble up, they arise. You don't get to have them when you want. They come to you. Certain settings or conditions may spark a thought, but you don't need to be in a room with other people for great ones to emerge. And you absolutely don't need to be huddled up breathing the same air to work on an idea. To play with an idea. To toss one back and forth with a partner, or two, or five. You just need the right minds, wherever they are, feeding on insights, wrapped around the same concepts. It's a fluid process, not a fixed one. You need communication, not presence. There may be times when being physically together helps something materialize.

If you don\u2019t love what you do, you might as well stay home. No less a giant than Steve Jobs famously told Stanford\u2019s 2005 graduating class, \u201cThe only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven\u2019t found it yet, keep looking. Don\u2019t settle.\u201dI don\u2019t buy it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with loving what you do, of course \u2013 I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s a prerequisite for starting a business or building a fulfilling career, let alone doing great work. In fact, I think it\u2019s disingenuous for really successful people to put so much of the focus on love, just as it\u2019s disingenuous for really rich people to say money doesn\u2019t matter. People tend to romanticize their own motivations and histories. They value what matters to them now, and forget what really mattered to them when they started. It\u2019s human nature, so it\u2019s an easy thing to do. Many great businesses and important innovations are actually born out of frustration or even hate rather than love. I talk to entrepreneurs all the time, and many of their companies sprang into existence for similar reasons\u2014because the founder wanted something that didn\u2019t exist or scoped out an opportunity to do something better than it had been done before. Love for their subject matter may or may not play a role in their stories, but hate for the existing options, along with strong opinions about how things could work, does and is a much better predictor of success. My own career is no exception. Back in the mid-\u201990s, I was looking for a simple tool to keep track of my music collection, and all of the available programs seemed bloated and unnecessarily complex. Those are two things I despise, so I set out to make my own tool and eventually released it under the name Audiofile. I didn\u2019t love music collecting. I didn\u2019t even love software development. (I was just learning it at the time.) And I didn\u2019t have any aspirations to run a software business \u2013 I just saw a need, couldn't find anything I thought was great, and I built something better. Nothing wrong with that. A similar situation led me to start and build 37signals and Basecamp. HEYEven today I don\u2019t always love what I do. The paperwork, the reporting, the day-to-day minutiae that come along with responsibility for growing company that's bigger than it's ever been \u2013 none of those things make me swoon. Yet I\u2019d still rather be running 37signals than doing anything else. I think I\u2019m fairly good at it, every day I get to do challenging, creative work, and I continue to find making better software a worthy and rewarding cause. It\u2019s also a real pleasure to work with such amazing people as I do every day of the week. Isn't that plenty? If I were giving a motivational speech, I\u2019d say that, if you want to be successful and make a real contribution to the world, you have to be intrinsically motivated by the work you do, and you have to feel good about spending your days on it. Love might grow \u2013 and it\u2019s a wonderful thing if it does\u2014but you don\u2019t need it up front. You can succeed just by wanting something to exist that doesn\u2019t already. -Jason", "date": "2022-10-27T00:00:00", "id": "659a661b-ea17-49dd-bd4b-dd2c5b576d2d", "author": "jason"}

For example, after a recent delivery, I got this text message: They ask me to rate my \"experience\". Thing is, I didn't have an *experience*. The delivery person just left the package by the mailbox and I grabbed it when I got home. And what does it mean to even rate a delivery like this? It showed up, it was correct... Is that a 5-star *experience*? Would it only be worth 3 stars if the package was lying on the ground instead of propped up against the wall? There isn't enough *there*there to even establish a value.

This time he was here to help us understand some truths about how we *really*run the business, make decisions, and value what's worth doing. When I say value, I don't mean a list of generalized \"values\", or the bullshit phrase of \"adding value\", but how we attribute value when evaluating our options and making tradeoffs.It was a very honest discussion, and I think it helped crystalize a number of things that we either take for granted, don't realize we do, or we haven't been able to elucidate and share broadly. One thing you realize when getting into this kind of work is that when something's an *instinct*, it feels so natural that you just assume everyone else thinks the same way. And it's a point of frustration when others don't approach something the way you can't help but approach it. But it's an unfair expectation. How could they? How would they? Why should they?Perspective resets like this are always helpful.

We talked on the phone before, but never met in person. We found ourselves in the same city, so it felt like it was time to shake hands and catch up IRL. He runs a company that's an order or magnitude larger than 37signals, so his experiences, responsibilities, and perspectives are quite a bit different from mine. But as we've careened towards our own renewed growth phase \u2014 we're currently larger than we've ever been, and still hiring \u2014 a few of his insights really resonated. And one really stuck. When he said it, I had to repeat it to make sure I heard it right. I wanted to sear the words in my brain so I both fully understood and wouldn't forget. He said \"Risk tolerance is the scarcest resource in most companies.\" I just love how that's framed. He then went on to say, and this one I'm paraphrasing a bit, that it's the one of the things that sets founder-led companies apart from founder-less companies. Founder-led companies tend to take more risks. They're more risk tolerant, less risk averse. He also related this to company size. This one's a bit more obvious \u2014 the larger the company, the more risk averse they are, even if they're still founder-led. But it's not just a pure function of size, which is the typical conclusion. No, it's about *distance*. The further away a founder is from would-be risky decisions, the more likely those decisions will be *safe*decisions. It's only natural. It made me realize something I may have inherently understood, but hadn't really realized was a unique responsibility of a founder who's still running the show: It's my job \u2014 my obligation, really \u2014 to fill the coffers with risk. It's my role to make sure there's an ample supply. No one else will produce it, and few will introduce it. The more it's drained, the more it needs to rain. While the company at large is focused on results, founders should be focused on taking chances. There are certain risks founders need to take that others will not. Step function changes, for example. Things that can't be explained by past results and experiments, but a hunch that the equation has changed. All the while keeping in mind that there's a notable difference between taking a risk and putting yourself at risk. So, if you've decided you want to take a risk, then take it. If you don't, then keep talking about it \u2014 it'll almost certainly talk you out of it. The safer option is the most abrasive \u2014 it'll wear down the risk, polish the edges, and make the object of beautiful and smooth. But risk needs to snag, or it isn't much of a risk at all. -Jason", "date": "2022-06-06T00:00:00", "id": "58f42429-b124-4afc-817e-e2cf432c10f5", "author": "jason"}
{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/wait-to-concentrate-9e936ef7", "title": "Procrastination and Its Benefits", "content": "Procrastination is often tagged as a negative. If you're putting something off until the last minute, it's assumed it's because you don't want to do it, or it's too hard, or you've been avoiding it for some other reason. Maybe I'm making excuses, but lately I've found procrastination can be aimed to your advantage. Not always, but more than I imagined. Procrastination has a way of concentrating attention. When it has to be done, and the clock is ticking, it blocks your attention from wandering to other things. There's simply no time, and the penalty for further delay is high. Concentrated attention, at least for me, helps me do my best work. It's as if attention is a reduced sauce, thickened and viscous, sticking to what I'm working on. Undivided, undiluted, unbroken. Procrastination helps wedge me into a sustained flow state. \"I have to get it done this afternoon\" turns into 3 or 4 hours of continuous, focused work. When the deadline is over the horizon, it's too easy to shatter those hours into ineffective slices of attention doled out over days or weeks. But when it's right in front of you, you tuck in, get real, and get it done. There are obviously occasions where you wish you had more time, or a second take, or another edit, but, more often than not, I find more time talks you out of your best ideas, and slips in too many second guesses. I think I'd rather take something slightly undercooked than overcooked. One downside of waiting is if others are waiting on you. Procrastination is disrespect if others need what you're making in order to move forward on what they need to make. So be sure to take that all into consideration too.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/getting-together-again-99d068f0", "title": "Renewing the Tradition: Basecamp's Miami Meetup", "content": "We've worked remotely for nearly 20 years, but we've sustained the distance by lining up intense, one-week-together-in-person bursts twice a year. Over the last 10 years, we've mainly held these bi-annual all-company meetups at our Chicago office. But the combination of the pandemic, and an expiring office lease in July of 2020, conspired to keep us apart for nearly 2.5 years. With the pandemic fading, mask mandates sunsetting, and travel opening back up, it was time to renew the tradition. So this last week, nearly our whole company got together in Miami for our first meetup in what felt like forever. With 65 people from 16 countries, Basecamp is now the biggest and broadest we\u2019ve ever been. Understandably not everyone could make it to the meetup for a number of reasons, but nearly 50 did, with the furthest-away flying in from Nairobi. I'm an introvert and homebody that's hardly comfortable always-on socializing with such a large group for days on end, but I have to tell you, I just loved it. Remote work remains our preferred method \u2014 and we'll continue building our global group remotely \u2014 but getting together like this brings crystal to clear: Nothing beats a meal, a smile, a handshake, and a hug in person. When a shared experience is the reason, humans connect better in person than they do over the internet. And, as it turns out, meeting infrequently makes those actual encounters far more meaningful. We didn't Miami was sunny, yes, but the camaraderie and fellowship was even sunnier. There was clearly a warm glow we'd all been missing. And with only one employee local to Miami, everyone else was in from out of town. It cemented the idea of being away, together, which amplified the shared experience. So, what did we do? We spent the first half of the first day introducing the more than 30 new people we've hired over the last eight months or so. Then Elaine (COO) took the stage and shared an update on the company itself. How we're growing, where we're going, and what we're focused on organizationally to put all this change to good use. After that, David and I took the stage to talk product and vision. We shared updates on Basecamp and HEY, discussed launch plans for Basecamp 4 this year, talked about some other news we'll be sharing publicly soon, and riffed on a few more product ideas that we're tossing around in our heads. Then it was lunch, some personal talks people signed up to give in the afternoon, and then off to the first all-company dinner. The following days after that were full of planned day trips and activities in and outside of Miami, an in-depth all-company training session that helped us to get to know one another in a novel new way, management and leadership training, small team meals, a heartfelt peer appreciation and recognition session, celebrating work anniversaries for those at 5-year increments (including one at 15 years), and a festive closing dinner with everyone on the last night. What a week. It's unusual to be both completely exhausted, but equally energized. But that's how I feel, and I'm hearing it from others too. This was a major reset, a chance to reinforce old relationships, form new connective tissue, and take a healthy hit from the optimism pipe. There were moments of reflection and appreciation, and a celebration of the culmination of new efforts we've been making, together, over the past year. We were just people from all over, loosely tied through shared work, simply having a great time. But there was something more. Even people who've worked together for 10 years felt like new friends. And those who were brand new fit right in. It was our company, it was our time, and it was just wonderful. If you've been remote for a while, now's the time \u2014 get together again. I really encourage you to draw the line, leap over it, and move on. It'll be the fresh start that everyone's been craving.", "date": "2022-03-26T00:00:00", "id": "795690c8-2513-459d-a83f-d3a8195d9479", "author": "jason"}

He hired someone to replace a bunch of windows at his house. The guy did the work. Poorly. And now it turns out he needs to have everything redone. Given how badly the job went, he's going to work with someone else to get it done right the second time. What's there isn't really salvageable. Even the windows themselves need to be reordered. It's a big number, it's real money. He's going to try to get some money back from the original guy who messed up the job, but it's a long road. Outcomes unknown. So he's staring at a big loss. He called me to talk about it. He asked me if I've ever experienced something like this, and how I coped with it. I absolutely have, and I've always found that how you frame it has a huge impact on how you feel about it. It allows you to move on. I told him the way I've approached this sort of thing in the past is to frame it as 'overall, this job cost more than I expected', rather than 'This guy fucked me, I'm out $X, and now I have to pay someone else $Y more to redo it'. Yes, the total is the same, but one involves loss while the other involves missed expectations. I find it a lot easier to deal with underestimating total cost than feeling like I got screwed. Construction projects frequently go over budget. People deal with this all the time. The community is large! You're a member now. Loss aversion is of course how it's described, but applying technical definitions doesn't often change how you feel.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/the-presence-prison-69608e0f", "title": "The Calm Company: Basecamp's Approach to Remote Work and Productivity", "content": "As a general rule, nobody at Basecamp really knows where anyone else is at any given moment. Are they working? Dunno. Are they taking a break? Dunno. Are they at lunch? Dunno. Are they picking up their kid from school? Dunno. Don\u2019t care. The vast majority of the time, it just doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is letting people design their own schedule around when they can do their best work. This is not nearly as hard as it sounds. But it does require a shift in mindset. Away from \u201cI have to call Jeff into a meeting now to get his take on this new feature idea\u201d to \u201cI\u2019ll write up my feature idea for Jeff to check-out whenever he has some free time, and then, maybe, we can have a chat about it live later, if needed\u201d. If you\u2019re constantly pulling people into things, then yeah, where they are right now matters. But if you prefer to let people consider something fully, and get back to you when they\u2019re ready, then it doesn\u2019t matter where they are right now. We choose the latter. We\u2019ve always worked like this at Basecamp. Since we\u2019ve always been a remote company with people spread out all over the world, we\u2019ve been forced to work this way. We learned to appreciate the benefits of working asynchronously quickly as we collaborated over seven time zones right from the start. But it wasn\u2019t until we gave up on Presence that we really got to embrace the sense of calm that comes from not caring about when someone is working (or not) or where someone is (or isn\u2019t) at this very moment. Presence is a feature of many modern communication work tools. It\u2019s generally represented by a green, red, or yellow dot. If there\u2019s a green dot next to someone\u2019s name it means they\u2019re available. Yellow or red means they\u2019re away. This is how many companies get a read on who\u2019s working when. For years we used an internal instant messaging system that broadcasted everyone\u2019s real-time status. It seemed cool, it seemed useful. It seemed like something that would be good to know. But it turned out to be TMI: Too Much Information. Because, really, what does \u201cavailable\u201d and \u201caway\u201d really mean? Official definitions don\u2019t matter, because here\u2019s what they actually mean: \u201cAvailable to be bothered\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m running away and hiding because I can\u2019t get any fucking work done around here.\u201d Away, in particular, can be seen as bad form. Stay \u201caway\u201d (which most often actually means you\u2019re working, but don\u2019t want to be bothered) and people begin to question if you\u2019re at work at all. Leave \u201caway\u201d on too long and you\u2019re seen as unreliable. If you\u2019ve got presence on your work tools, you\u2019ve probably lived this very thing. What a joke, right? And \u201cavailable\u201d is usually just an invitation to be interrupted. Try being available for 3 hours, and then try being away for 3 hours. Bet you get more work done when you\u2019re marked away. Truth is, there are hardly any good reasons to know if someone\u2019s available or away at any given moment. If you truly need something from someone, ask them. If they respond, then you have what you needed. If they don\u2019t, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re ignoring you \u2014 it\u2019s because they\u2019re busy. Respect that! Assume people are focused on their own work. Are there exceptions? Of course. It might be good to know who\u2019s around in a true emergency, but 1% occasions like that shouldn\u2019t drive policy 99% of the time. And there are times where certain teams need to make sure someone\u2019s around so there are no gaps in customer service coverage, but those are specialized cases best handled by communication, not an ambiguous colored dot next to someone\u2019s name. These days at Basecamp we eschew status, we reject presence, we avoid abstraction. In fact, when designing the latest version of Basecamp, we deliberately decided to keep status and presence out of the product. We had it early on during the design process, but then we turned it off and we never missed it. The moment it was gone, a burden was lifted and things calmed down around here. So take a step towards calm, and relieve people from needing to broadcast their status. They\u2019ve got enough work to do \u2014 managing how they\u2019re presenting their availability to the company at large is an unnecessary burden. Everyone\u2019s status should be implicit: I\u2019m trying to do my job, please respect my time and attention.", "date": "2022-01-25T00:00:00", "id": "580d5c17-b4b0-41a3-8a8b-d5f25a234370", "author": "jason"}

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/deployments-how-we-announce-new-features-and-updates-internally-at-basecamp-b709544e", "title": "Deployments: How we announce new features and updates internally at Basecamp", "content": "A few weeks ago I shared how we write Heartbeats at Basecamp. Heartbeats are written by team leads that summarize their team's work over the past 6-week cycle. They are published to Basecamp, and shared with everyone at Basecamp, so everyone knows what's happening across the company. The post was really well received, and people have been clamoring for me to share more of our internal processes and posts. Our book Shape Up covers a lot of this in principle, but, since it's a book, it's obviously not going to have current, ongoing real-world examples. And who doesn't like to see the real stuff? I sure do! So here, let's look at something that was posted internally, today. Deployments In our own Basecamp account, we have a project called Deployments. Everyone in the company has access to the Deployment project. Whenever we ship a new feature or update to any one of our products, one of the people who did the work also writes up a message in the Deployment project that explains what's new, points out what could be an issue, and, in some cases, provides a link to the repo on Github. Here's a snapshot of the Message Board inside the Deployment project. Just this morning we shipped a brand new feature in Basecamp called The Lineup. Dorin was the lead designer on the project and wrote up the internal Deployment notice. Here it is: Now that's only the the top. Here's a link to read the entire Deployment notice, exactly as it was published internally. You'll see it contains screenshots, explanations of how things work, animations showing specific interactions, the why's behind the how's, decisions that were made, and a variety of details that demonstrate the work that went into the feature, etc. Often time these Deployment write-ups are posted a bit ahead of actually shipping the project. They're sort of a heads up \u2014 something new is coming and going out to customers shortly. And then, once it ships, someone follows up with a comment like this: In the example above, Dorin (the designer on the project) posted the big announcement at 10:34am, and Pratik (the programmer on the project, and the one who deployed the update), posted his 'This is now live!' comment at 10:49am, about 15 minutes later. Aside from these Deployment notices keeping everyone informed of what's new at a high level, they're wonderful for those on the front lines too. People answering questions from customers, anyone interacting with customers on Twitter or LinkedIn, etc. Everyone internally knows, and everyone internally can speak with confidence on how things work, why things work the way they work, etc. And of course, since everything in Basecamp has a comments thread attached, any follow-up questions or updates on the release can be posted right on this page as well. No spreading stuff all over the place in different chat transcripts \u2014 in Basecamp, everything is contextual, in the right place, attached, and easy to find and reference later. And what's especially useful about the Deployments project, and the Message Board in particular, is that over time we're automatically building an institutional library of progress. Here's what we've done, here's how we've done it, and here's how it works. It's such a great place for new employees to get up to speed on the kind of work we do, and it's full of examples of how we communicate internally and externally about the work we ship. Whenever I see a notification in my Basecamp Hey menu from the Deployments project, it puts a special smile on my face. It's a celebration of progress, of teamwork, of our products getting better, or our customers getting something new, and of good writing making its way across the company. -Jason About Jason Fried Hey!

Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019re seeing in front of you. Yet. That\u2019s when you need to have faith. There are designs that are close, but not there yet. There are obvious conflicts that will need to be resolved. There are lingering things that confound you, confuse you, or upset you, but you know that eventually they\u2019ll work themselves out. Eventually you\u2019ll find the right way to do something you\u2019ve been struggling with. It\u2019s hard to live with something that isn\u2019t quite right yet \u2013 especially when it\u2019s your job to get it right.

And when I can, I try to leave evidence of that moment in whatever it is that I\u2019m building. When we launched our company (37signals) back in 1999, we launched a black and white, text-only site without a single piece of portfolio work to be found. All the other agencies we were competing with had very flashy pages, loaded with pictures of their work. So why black and white and text only? Because why the hell not lead with ideas rather than compete on pictures? We thought it could be better that way. It worked out well for us. One of my favorite why the hell not moments was when we were writing REWORK. One of the things that always bugs me about paper books is that you have to leaf through a dozen or so pages before you arrived at page one of the actual text. You\u2019ve got the testimonials, the table of contents, the dedication/acknowledgement page, the copyright page, usually a blank page, a title page, etc\u2026 THEN you get to the book. This is also one of the reasons I really like cracking into a new book on the Kindle \u2014 you start right at the text. So when we were talking to our publisher about how we wanted REWORK to be organized and designed, I asked them if we could put the copyright page at the end, rather than the beginning. It would be one fewer page to leaf through up front, and if any page was ignored more than the others, it had to be the copyright page. So why the hell not just put it at the back? Initially our publisher didn\u2019t know how to respond. No one had ever asked that before and they\u2019d never seen an example of a copyright page in the back. But ultimately they said yes, so today if you pick up a copy of REWORK, and go to the last page, you\u2019ll find the copyright page right there in the back of the book on page 280: You\u2019ll also find the acknowledgement page on page 279, rather than right up front: Whenever I\u2019m struggling with a decision that seems \u201cunusual\u201d, I\u2019ll look back at these two pages in REWORK and remind myself that just because everyone else does something one way doesn\u2019t mean you have to do it that way.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/what-s-in-a-heartbeat-4fd72d0e", "title": "Long-Form Writing at Basecamp: Heartbeats and More", "content": "We're famous for having very few meetings at Basecamp. We generally think meetings are toxic. Yet, meetings do convey information, and we need to convey information, so what's our replacement? Writing. Long-form, complete-thought, considered writing. We write a lot at Basecamp. Since long-form writing is an asynchronous form of communication, people can publish thoughts when they're ready, and others can read them, consider them, and respond to them when they have time. No synchronization of schedules required, no pulling people off their work to sit around a table (or show their face in a box on the screen), and none of the FOMO or stress that's tied to real-time communication like group chat. Long-form writing takes many forms at Basecamp, but \"Heartbeats\" are a prime example. Heartbeats \u2014 written by team leads roughly every 6 weeks \u2014 are published to a message board in a Basecamp project called \"What Works\". Everyone in the company can see this project, and can read every Heartbeat. A Heartbeat summarizes all the work the team did over the last 6-week cycle. It's a way to celebrate progress, recognize contributions, and detail the sheer quantity of work a team gets done in a relatively short period of time (via standard ~40-hour weeks). It's a perfect way for everyone to get to know what's happening across every team in the company \u2014 all without having to schedule a thing. Let's take a look at an example of an actual Heartbeat. We've opened it up via a public Basecamp link so everyone can see it. This one was written by Jeff, who leads up the Product Programming team here at Basecamp. This Heartbeat is about 95% the same as the one we published internally \u2014 a few things have been struck, changed, or modified since they weren't originally written for public consumption. Jeff has granted me permission to share this publicly. Note the links in the Heartbeat won't work b/c they are links to our internal Basecamp account. Now multiply that Heartbeat by many teams \u2014 programmers, designers, security, customer service, operations, admin, etc \u2014 and you can see how these Heartbeats become a wonderful record of everything that's happening across the whole company on a regular basis. A library of accomplishments (and, sometimes, setbacks) for everyone's benefit \u2014 including future employees who don't work here yet. Reading back through Heartbeats are a great way to get a sense of the things we do around here, how we work, who's doing what, and how we recognize each other's efforts. Make sense? Heartbearts are just one example of the kind of long-form writing we do here. In a future post, I'll talk about Kickoffs \u2014 predictions for what we want to get done in the next 6 weeks. Both Heartbeats and Kickoffs are fundamental parts of our Shape Up process. Hope this was helpful. If you have any questions, lemme know. -Jason About Jason Fried Hey!

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/distracting-is-it-3b23e5cf", "title": "Understanding Distracting Elements in Design", "content": "In the course of designing user interfaces, and processing feedback about designs, one sometimes runs into a 'That's distracting' comment about something specific in the design. You may even say it \u2014 or feel it \u2014 about something you're designing. What's distracting about it? Maybe something's too colorful. Maybe it's something regarding the layout. Maybe it's the ordering of elements, or the size or proportion of something related to something else. Maybe it's a specific animation. Maybe it's even a sound generated by a specific action, button press, or gesture. So what do you do? You look, you consider. But when you're staring at the thing that prompted the feedback, it's common to narrow your focus until only the offending element is in view. Essentially, when someone says 'it's this thing', it's only natural to look at *that thing*. It's no different than looking *over there* when someone points off into the distance. You adjust your gaze to meet their attention. At their direction, you're looking for *something at the expense of everything else.* But it's not the thing that matters here, it's the broader context. It's not the focus, it's the zoom. Something can be distracting bad (it makes it hard to focus on what really matters), or distracting good (it calls your attention to something you need to know about right now). And something can also be distracting in theory, and completely not in practice. There are many contexts, and you can't evaluate subjective design feedback without considering the whole context in which it exists. For example, today I was driving on the highway, weaving in and out of traffic trying to make up some time because I was running late (dumb, I know). In my car, one of the digital gauge cluster icons can be changed to a g-force indicator. It's a little dot that animates across a field in real time based on the g's you're pulling. Since I was weaving and changing directions, the dot was slamming from side to side. It looks something like this, except that you have to imagine the dot moving around as you're driving, not fixed in the middle as in this example: ![gforce.jpg](https://world.hey.com/jason/3b23e5cf/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCTXdnUmlRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e495c07fa26683dcaec150dd560db525983c0ae0/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19 --0b5e092e6240e14fab357b4c1013c9a0c881ff87/gforce.jpg) Now, I can imagine a design review session where designers presented this idea and someone said 'a dot constantly moving around would be distracting for the driver.' If we view this in isolation, they'd have a point. Especially since we imagine the gauge cluster being in front of the driver. So on paper, yes, it certainly might be distracting. And even in an isolated simulation it could be distracting. And if you were staring at the element in the graphics or animation program where it was initially mocked up and conceived, it would probably be distracting \u2014 especially if you're watching a prototype animation endlessly loop. And if it was presented as a static image surrounded by annotated comments, then you could be convinced it was distracting. And if your head is full of review feedback about how distracting it could be, then it certainly may be hard to imagine it in any other way than distracting. But this gauge, and this animated dot, *isn't actually distracting* in practice. Turns out, the gauge cluster is in front of you, but it's below your field of vision. It's in your periphery. You aren't tracking it, and you don't notice it unless you look at it. In the context of driving, yes the dot is moving, but your eyes are fixed on motion *outside*. The road is moving, cars are moving, the landscape is moving, street signs are moving. And those movements are relatively huge compared to that tiny little dot. The big motion is what captures your attention. The dot doesn't distract. In fact, you don't even notice it unless you look. It can't win your attention unless you give it your attention. You are in control, the dot is not. Now this is an example from the automotive world. But this comes up in software design all the time. Mockups aren't real. Looking at screens or designs in isolation limits your ability to think about the whole system. Reducing elements to their objective qualities (size, color, etc) flattens them and removes the richness of the situation, the moment, the time, and the context in which they exist. The user isn't evaluating, *the user is using* for a reason, in a given context, with more going on in their world than just that element, that object, and that screen in front of them. All this is simply a reminder to resist the urge to focus in on isolated feedback. Rather, zoom out and look at the whole. Get real with it. Then consider.", "date": "2021-11-19T00:00:00", "id": "7e5c97aa-a130-4235-9409-d0dca68f05f0", "author": "jason"}

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/fewer-options-can-create-more-optionality-4ac9b067", "title": "Designing products: Fewer options, more optionality", "content": "Designing products is one of my favorite things to do \u2014 period. There's a lot to love. The twists and turns, the surprises, the creative explorations, the collaboration, and the moments when things really come together. But it's the practical choices, the tough decisions, and the tradeoffs that really make the work challenging and interesting. I'm long for that kind of work. When building products you're occasionally reminded of a peculiar \u2014 somewhat magical \u2014 irony: That reducing options can create more optionality. And that you can actually do less work and get more out of it. Case in point. We're currently working on adding autoresponders to HEY. Since these are frequently used by people who are going out of town, we began the flow with specifying a start and end date. If anyone emails you between these two dates, we'll auto-respond with some text you've written in advance. This is basically how most autoresponders work. But one of our rules around here is that we're always aiming to get something working within the first week of working on it. Not mockups, but HTML+CSS hooked up to backend code that works and does something for real. It's a healthy exercise that forces you into discovering the epicenter, and figuring out the essence of the idea where the bulk of the value resides. So what does someone need to set up an autoresponder that responds while you're gone for a while? It's not actually a date range, it's simply an on or off switch. Dates turn the autoresponder on or off, but so would a simple, single on/off toggle. Want your autoresponder on? Flip the switch. Want it off when you return? Flip the switch. One toggle switch is all you need to get this working. It's also the fastest way to get this working. This is when the magic happens. A simple switch eliminates all sorts of work, edge cases, error states, etc. When you set dates, you have to account for potential error states. The start date could be after the end date. Or the date format you enter could be wrong. Or what if you entered the same date for start and end? Or what if you leave one date field blank but fill in the other? There's much to account for, and accounting for all those things requires work, hidden states, contingency design (designing for when things go wrong), additional QA testing, etc. The on/off binary is better. It's clearer, easier, more flexible, and fewer things can go wrong. On/off gives you something else too: The freedom to not have to know when you're returning. On = out for as long as you're out. This unlocks another use case: The perpetual autoresponder. Some people prefer an autoresponder whenever someone emails them. They essentially use it as a README \u2014 laying down the rules of email engagement. We initially considered a perpetual autoresponder as a separate feature, but when you simplify into on/off, on = away for now or always and forever. You get two for one, it's up to you. So that's where we're starting. On/off. And it's likely where we're ending. By eliminating options we've simplified the product, reduced the potential for errors or confusion, and we also got a perpetual autoresponder feature for free. Fewer options, more optionality.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/how-we-acquired-hey-com-2e3e0d5f", "title": "How We Acquired hey.com", "content": "As more and more people discover our new email service, \u2014 Back on June 9, 2018, I cold emailed HEY.com, I continue to get questions about how we acquired the domain name. While I can't tell you how much it cost, I can share the story behind the acquisition process. Here goes:\u2014 Back on June 9, 2018, I cold emailed help@hey.com:Hey there\u2013 Curious\u2026 Would you entertain an offer to sell hey.com? I'd like to use it for something I'm working on, and willing to make you a strong offer. Let me know. Thanks! -Jason And that\u2019s where it all began. For the 25+ years I\u2019ve been emailing, I\u2019d say close to 95% of those email began with some variation of \u201cHey [Name]\u201d. So when it came time to think about a name for a new email system we\u2019d be building, HEY was a natural. Further, the \u201cHey!\u201d menu in Basecamp3 holds your notifications for new messages, chats, to-do assignments, automatic check-in prompts, boost summaries, and the like. So we already had some prior art on Hey being a place for communication.But hey.com \u2013 that would be an amazing email address, and, we rightly assumed, hard to get. But what the hell \u2013 if you don\u2019t ask you don\u2019t get, so I sent the email, crossed my fingers, and waited. The same day I emailed, June 9, 2018, he replied. Turns out we\u2019d actually talked before on This Week in Tech, way back when. This was his first email back to me: Hi Jason: Thanks for reaching out, I've always respected your business accomplishments and your writing. You may not remember but we spoke briefly a couple of times when I was at TWiT. As you might imagine, I've gotten a number of offers and inquiries about HEY.com over the years. Usually I ignore them, but very happy to chat with you about this or any other topic. I'm on cell at ###-###-####. Thanks! Dane So we set up a call and had a nice chat. Really nice guy. A few days later, I made an offer. He said no. So I countered. He said no. We were clearly way off. And the momentum went cold. He decided he wasn\u2019t ready to sell. I thanked him for the opportunity and said let\u2019s stay in touch. Then on August 19, 2019, well over a year after my initial outreach, he wrote me back. Hi Jason: Not sure if you're still interested in Hey.com, but I'm in the process of vetting what appears to be a serious inquiry to buy it. The numbers being discussed are notably higher than what you mentioned previously. Given your previous offer I'm thinking you probably won't be interested, but I appreciated your approach andalso what you've done for the industry, so I thought I'd let you know as a courtesy. We caught up via Zoom a few days later, discussed again, and I made another offer. This time significantly higher than our original offer. It was a nervous amount of money. Things were beginning to heat up, but there was no deal yet. I completely understood \u2013 he owned this domain for a long time, and he wasn\u2019t a squatter. Dane used hey.com for his business. It was part of his identity. It was a valuable asset. He needed time to think it through. We traded a number of other emails, and then I upped the offer a little bit more on September 18, 2019. A few days later we\u2019d verbally agreed to move forward on an all-cash deal with a number of stipulations, conditions, etc. All were perfectly reasonable, so we asked him to prepare a contract. There were a few small back and forths, but we essentially accepted his contract and terms as is. We wired the money into escrow, we waited for some Google mail transfer stuff to finish up, and on November 20th, 2019 the domain was officially transferred over into our ownership. Funds were released to escrow, and the deal was done. This was a long 18 month process, and there was uncertainty at every step. We\u2019d never bought a domain like this, he\u2019d never sold a domain like this. There\u2019s a lot of trust required on all sides. And more than money, hey.com was important to him. And who he sold it to was important to him as well. But it was truly a pleasure to work with him. Dane was fair, thoughtful, patient, and accommodating. And for that we\u2019re grateful. Business deals like this can get messy, but this one was clean and straightforward. Kudos to him and his lawyer for their diligence and clear communication. All in we traded 60+ emails over the course of the deal. Toss in a few zoom calls as well. So that\u2019s the story of how we acquired hey.com. One cold email to kick it off, no domain brokers or middlemen, and a lot of patience and understanding on both sides. Wait how much was it? I know everyone wants to know, but we can\u2019t say. Both sides are bound by a non-disclosure around the final purchase price. You\u2019ll just have to guess. As for Dane, he relaunched his brand under a new name. You can check him out at VidiUp.tv.As for us, if you're curious what email could be like if a company that gave a damn about email actually put in the effort to make it markedly better, check out HEY.com.*Note: This post was cleared with Dane prior to publishing, so he\u2019s cool with me sharing his name, the story, and the name of his new company.*", "date": "2021-10-20T00:00:00", "id": "be31eacc-fa99-454d-8797-8707021d01e3", "author": "jason"}

One of renewed ambition and a desire to excel on a variety of fronts, simultaneously. We're no longer just going all-in on something we make, we're going all-out on everything we do. To get there, David and I realized we needed a peer, someone who can help us run the business day-to-day, and think about the business year-to-year. So a few months back we began searching for a new COO. We've had someone in this role before, but the position has been conspicuously vacant for 5 years. This new COO would help us build a more capable company. To grow the business, and question core assumptions that planted us in the past, rather than push us into the future. We're pleased to report that after a long, thorough search, we were fortunate to find the perfect match. Her name is The search process was enlightening. Some of the candidates we spoke just weren't the right fit for us. Some you're really excited about at the start, but the excitement wanes the further along you get. Others start strong and keep getting stronger as you go. That was Elaine. The first time David and I talked to Elaine we thought \"Oh she's good, we want to talk with her again.\" Then we talked again and said \"She's really good\". The next call ended with \"She's great\". And when we met in person, things kept getting better. That's when we knew she was a lock. During the interview process we introduced her to a few other senior folks here, and they all felt the same way. That sealed the deal for us. Her experience was spot-on relevant, and we were impressed by how she approached various real-time scenarios we lobbed her way. It seemed like nothing phased her, which gave us a high degree of confidence she could handle the unknown and unpredictable. She wasn't afraid to disagree, and when she did, she always helped us see the concern from a different point of view. Her writing is both expressive and crystal clear, and our conversations were effortless, as if we worked together for a decade. Finally, her references drove home the point that Elaine always demonstrates honest care and concern for the people she works with. It kept lining up until it all lined up. One thing in particular Elaine is going to help with is developing leaders from within, and bringing in leadership from the outside to help grow groups and teams we've never had before. We'll finally be able to get to things we've had on the back burner for, in some case, years. This will also free people up who've been doing double duty in specific roles. The remainder of 2021 is about continuing to pump out excellent product updates for our Basecamp 4 and HEY customers, and putting the pieces in place to set the stage for significant growth in 2022. More leadership, dozens of new colleagues from all over the world, new teams, significant product improvements, and enhanced capabilities all wrapped up with a new sense of ambition and possibilities. In many ways we're starting over with a huge head start. And Elaine's expertise gives us another unfair advantage.

It was a lovely remembrance, primarily orbiting the sanctity of the creative process and the burbling of ideas. It reminded me about something else Jony said about Steve in shortly after his death:\"And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood thatwhile ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.\" \u2014Jonathan Ive That isn't a vapid business quote. Or Steve Jobs idolatry. It's just plain fucking true. It's so easy to lather up with scrutiny. To inject a full dose of doubt into an incipient idea that was on the inside just a moment before. There's nothing particularly constructive about knocking something new, rushing to point out the problems, demanding immediate justification, or convincing yourself it simply won't work. It's so tempting to do, especially because you're almost always guaranteed to be right that it's wrong. The hard thing is to make room for what *may*be possible. To help it unfurl. To encourage emergence, to explore, to expand. To be part of the soil that helps something blossom. To wonder what could be before it can be. To simply give something a chance before smashing it to bits. Expecting a new idea to come out fully formed would be like asking a newborn baby to explain itself. You wouldn't assume a blank stare, shrill cry, and complete bewilderment means it'll never amount to anything. But with new ideas \u2014 often just ebbing echos of a freeform riff \u2014 that's a common presumption. It's not the creative moment, it's the creative *process*\u2014 a series of layered events, similar to baking a cake. Doubt and skepticism are part of the recipe, but if you mix them in at the wrong time, things won't come together. Of course ideas eventually need to stand up for themselves, to resolve, to be viable. But not 5 minutes in. Ideas \u2014 especially unconventional ones \u2014 are such defenseless, easy targets. Medieval towns without walls. Snails without shells. Which brings me to improv. Something I've never done, but deeply admire. Improv practices a potent form of protectionism that primes the pump for possibilities. At the root of improv is the clever concept of \"Yes, And\". \"Yes, And\" creates an ally. It forces a partner to avoid rejection, and, instead, find a flow. To go with it, to work with it, to run with it. The primary aim is to make it work, and see what that work makes. It's not one against the other, it's both for co-creation. It's a framework for building something up, not shutting something down. \"Yes, And\" fuels the creative process and protects the fledgling spark. It's the code for curiosity. Let's see where it goes, rather than assume we already know where it'll end up. And like many improv skits, things don't always end up working out. Some ideas just peter out, or wander towards worse. They're \"Yes, Anded\" all the way to Not Funny. It happens, frequently! When talking ideas, the time will *always*come for \"Now What?\" Or \"How Then?\" Or \"Yeah, But\". And likely, eventually, \"Hell No\". At some point, justification is *required*, as it should be. But don't start there. Create a vacuum early, otherwise apprehension rushes in. There are few things as deeply satisfying \u2014 as thirst quenching \u2014 as partners who know when the \"Yes, And\" rules apply, collectively finding their way towards something unknown, promising, and inspiring, together. \"A mind is like a parachute.

We just completed the search process for a new COO at Basecamp. It's essentially a brand new position at the company. We had a COO for one year about five years ago, but for the rest of our 22 year existence, we haven't had someone in that position. The only two C-level executives at Basecamp (and 37signals before that) have been me and David. We're deficient in Vitamin C. Aside from exposing us to a number of smart people we'd never have met on our own, the search also carved out a wonderful space to reflect. Reflect on what we've built over the last 22 years, how we've built it, and where we want to go next. In that reflection I spotted a reality I hadn't really considered. We've built an outstanding Why was this new to me? As Orwell said, to see what's in front of one\u2019s nose needs a constant struggle. We've leaned on a formula with just a few ingredients \u2014 strong products, strong opinions, strong word of mouth growth, and strong individual contributors. While hundreds of smart, autonomous decisions are made by people doing the work, and valuable contributions come from all corners, David and I are the only two tasked with thinking strategically about the company itself. That feels flimsy. If nothing else, two people who see many things the same way inherently lack perspective. That view can still get you far, but how much further could we go with a wider point of view coming from a dozen distributed eyes, rather than four centralized ones? So as part of hiring our COO, we're going to begin investing significantly on developing leaders from within, and bringing in structural leadership from the outside. More people with an executive mindset to complement our outstanding crew of individual contributors. And we'll build out a few new dedicated groups and departments that were perviously handled on borrowed time by people already responsible for doing other jobs. Further, we're going invest in other forms of resiliency and redundancy throughout the company. Historically we've run Basecamp with an eye towards efficiency. We've run exceptionally lean, and to great effect. But running on 3% body fat forever isn't healthy over the long term. We need more It'll take some time, we'll bump into obstacles we can't yet see, certain setups will turn out to be setbacks, but it all starts with a commitment to improve. All this is to say we're about to rework ourselves into a more capable company. One that's doing more, in parallel, rather than sequentially. One that doesn't balance on a couple points, but rather one that's supported by a grid of columns. Swipe a leg, the others keep us standing. Stable, resilient, and distributed. Stronger. I never looked forward to building a bigger company. Reflexively, I've always wanted to keep thing as small as possible. Like an instinct I knew by heart, baked in by hearing myself say it \u2014 and think it \u2014 over and over.

This was an aesthetic exercise \u2014 aiming to find a better balance of leaves, branches, light, shadow, density, open space, shape, etc. Part of this process was also getting rid of suckers, crossing branches, and limiting general verticality. We wanted the trees to look more relaxed and open, while feeling natural, not manicured. It's active, iterative, and hugely satisfying work. While we were cutting branches, I noticed him reaching down into the soil and smudging the cut ends with soil. \"What's that about?\" I asked. \"Ah, this helps hide the bright cuts so they don't stand out,\" he said. Smudging some soil on the cut wood helps mellow the color of the exposed wood and blend it into the surrounding darker bark.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/the-path-to-basecamp-4-7516ee5b", "title": "Something new is on the way. But first, some history.", "content": "Basecamp Classic, the very first version of Basecamp, launched in 2004. In 2012, we followed up with the all-new Basecamp 2, the first major ground-up redesign in the product's history. Then we did it again in 2015 with Basecamp 3. We've been updating Basecamp 3 ever since, and today's version is the best, most popular version of Basecamp we've ever built. But we're not stopping there. Basecamp 4 is next. And it's coming. We've been working on the conceptual underpinnings of Basecamp 4 for nearly a year. We're now in the process of building it out for you. Historically, when we've released a major new update, we've waited until all the new features were done before releasing it one big drop. That could take 8-12 months of development before customers got the new stuff. Further, we've always released major new versions as separate products, keeping the previous versions around for customers who wanted to stick with what they knew rather than move to the latest version. We're going to do things differently this time. Times two, actually. Rather than release Basecamp 4 in one big drop, and rather than building it out as an entirely separate product, we're going to transform Basecamp 3 into Basecamp 4 by delivering a steady batch of deliberate, regular updates, roughly every 6-8 weeks, over the next 8 months or so. When we've released all the updates we had planned, Basecamp 3 will officially become Basecamp 4. This means all Basecamp 3 customers will get the new version, and all the new features, automatically, over time, as we go. Of course we won't stop after 8 months \u2014 Basecamp will continue to get better and better in perpetuity \u2014 but within about 8 months or so we expect to have all the major features we were aiming to get into the initial Basecamp 4 release. We'll be carefully rolling out changes to minimize disruptions. We'll be updating the interface too, gently and incrementally, to help customers adapt as we go, rather than be surprised by big sweeping changes one random day. Naturally there may be some changes that are bigger than others, but we'll be mindful about impact as we go. You won't have to do anything \u2014 you'll just notice the new stuff as it comes in. And we'll do our best to preview any major changes before they launch, and explain all the new stuff once it goes live. Shortly we'll reveal the first batch of updates, including a design refresh and the ability to add multiple tools to a project (so individual projects can have multiple message boards, or multiple campfire chat rooms, for example).

We're incorporating loads of customer feedback, brand new ideas of our own, and weaving in a new degree of flexibility that'll make Basecamp 4 the new best Thanks for your patience while we roll this out. And thanks again for all your support \u2014 we're thrilled to bring you some great stuff in the coming months. More updates to follow. Basecamp Classic, the very first version of Basecamp, launched in 2004. In 2012, we followed up with the all-new Basecamp 2, the first major ground-up redesign in the product's history. Then we did it again in 2015 with Basecamp 3. We've been updating Basecamp 3 ever since, and today's version is the best, most popular version of Basecamp we've ever built. But we're not stopping there. Basecamp 4 is next. And it's coming. We've been working on the conceptual underpinnings of Basecamp 4 for nearly a year. We're now in the process of building it out for you. Historically, when we've released a major new update, we've waited until all the new features were done before releasing it one big drop. That could take 8-12 months of development before customers got the new stuff. Further, we've always released major new versions as separate products, keeping the previous versions around for customers who wanted to stick with what they knew rather than move to the latest version. We're going to do things differently this time. Times two, actually. Rather than release Basecamp 4 in one big drop, and rather than building it out as an entirely separate product, we're going to transform Basecamp 3 into Basecamp 4 by delivering a steady batch of deliberate, regular updates, roughly every 6-8 weeks, over the next 8 months or so. When we've released all the updates we had planned, Basecamp 3 will officially become Basecamp 4. This means all Basecamp 3 customers will get the new version, and all the new features, automatically, over time, as we go. Of course we won't stop after 8 months \u2014 Basecamp will continue to get better and better in perpetuity \u2014 but within about 8 months or so we expect to have all the major features we were aiming to get into the initial Basecamp 4 release. We'll be carefully rolling out changes to minimize disruptions. We'll be updating the interface too, gently and incrementally, to help customers adapt as we go, rather than be surprised by big sweeping changes one random day. Naturally there may be some changes that are bigger than others, but we'll be mindful about impact as we go. You won't have to do anything \u2014 you'll just notice the new stuff as it comes in. And we'll do our best to preview any major changes before they launch, and explain all the new stuff once it goes live. Shortly we'll reveal the first batch of updates, including a design refresh and the ability to add multiple tools to a project (so individual projects can have multiple message boards, or multiple campfire chat rooms, for example). We're starting small \u2014 we'll ramp up with the big new features, changes, and ideas in the months ahead. So here we go. Basecamp 4 is coming.

In fact, I often do have the time. It\u2019s not that hard to squeeze in some extra time for someone. What I don\u2019t have \u2013 and what I can\u2019t squeeze in \u2013 is more attention. Attention is a far more limited resource than time. So what I should say is \u201cI don\u2019t have the attention\u201d. I may have 8 hours a day for work, but I probably have 4 hours a day for attention. One summer, a guy wrote me out of the blue asking if he could intern for me. His email was great \u2013 clear, thoughtful, kind, inviting, confident but not pushy, and not too long (but long enough to say what he had to say without leaving anything out). He was studying at Harvard Business School and was going to be back in Chicago that summer. He asked if he could swing by and say hi. His email made it easy for me to say yes. So he did, and we had a great session. We spent maybe an hour or so together. I learned about his background, what kind of stuff he was interested in, what he wanted to learn, what he could teach us, etc. Then we riffed on a few ideas. It was natural, flowing, effortless. Really promising. Then I told him I\u2019d think a few things over and get back to him soon. He checked in a few weeks later, and I said I\u2019d get back to him soon again. And I didn\u2019t. A month or so after that I wrote him and told him I was really sorry. I\u2019d mislead him \u2013 and myself \u2013 thinking I had enough time to take on a intern that summer. I wanted to, I really liked him, I thought he\u2019d be great, but I just didn\u2019t have as much time as I thought I had to even consider it more and line up work and spend time with him, etc. But really, as I thought about it, I realized I had the time. Every day is the same 24 hour cycle. Every workday around 8 hours. Surely I could have found even 20 minutes a day to work with him. But it wasn\u2019t that. It wasn\u2019t that I couldn\u2019t find the time. I couldn\u2019t find the *attention*\u2014 especially *sustained* attention. My mind fills up with a few key projects and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m absorbed by those. That\u2019s where my attention is. Had I made 20 minutes here and there for him, I\u2019d be physically present in that moment, but mentally I\u2019d be elsewhere. And that\u2019s not fair to either of us. Time and attention aren\u2019t the same thing. They're barely related.", "date": "2021-08-17T00:00:00", "id": "5c13840c-11a7-4dc6-8b69-332df1c8e614", "author": "jason"}

Probably too often. For many, \u201cit\u2019s crazy at work\u201d has become their normal. But why's that? At the root is an onslaught of physical and virtual real-time distractions slicing work days into a series of fleeting work moments. Tie that together with a trend of over-collaboration, plus an unhealthy obsession with unprofitable growth at any cost, and you\u2019ve got the building blocks for an anxious, crazy mess. It\u2019s no wonder people are working longer, earlier, later, on weekends, and whenever they have a spare moment. People can\u2019t get work done at work anymore. Work claws away at life. Life has become work\u2019s leftovers. The doggy bag. The remnants. The scraps. That\u2019s just not OK. It\u2019s unacceptable. What\u2019s worse is that long hours, excessive busyness, and lack of sleep have become a badge of honor for many people these days. Sustained exhaustion is not a badge of honor, it\u2019s a mark of stupidity. Companies that force their crew into this bargain are cooking up dumb at their employees\u2019 expense. And it\u2019s not just about organizations \u2014 individuals, contractors, and solopreneurs are burning themselves out the very same way. You\u2019d think with all the hours people are putting in, and all the promises of tech\u2019s flavor of the month, the load would be lessening. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s getting heavier. But the thing is, there\u2019s not more work to be done all of the sudden. The problem is there\u2019s hardly any uninterrupted, dedicated time to do it. Working more but getting less done? It doesn\u2019t add up. But it does \u2014 it adds up to a majority of time wasted on things that don\u2019t matter. Many modern companies seem to be great at one thing: wasting. Wasting time, attention, money, energy. Out of the 60, 70, 80 hours a week many are expected to pour into work, how many of those hours are really spent on the work itself? And how many are tossed away in meetings, lost to distraction, and withered away by inefficient business practices? The bulk. The answer isn\u2019t more hours, it\u2019s less bullshit. Less waste, not more production. And far fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety, and stress. Stress is an infection passed down from organization to employee, from employee to employee, and then from employee to customer. And it\u2019s becoming resistant to traditional treatments. The same old medicine is only making it worse. And remember, stress can not be contained. It never stops at the edge of work. It always bleeds into life. It infects your relationships with your friends, your family, your kids. The promises keep coming. More time management hacks. More ways to communicate. More information spread across separate platforms and disparate places. New demands to pay attention to more and more real-time conversations happening all the time at work. Faster and faster, for what? Panaceas left and right. Snake oil. On-demand is for movies, TV shows, and podcasts, not for you. Your time isn\u2019t an episode recalled when someone wants it at 10pm on a Saturday night, or every few minutes in the collection of conveyor belt chat room conversations you\u2019re supposed to be following all day long. If it\u2019s constantly crazy at work, we have two words for you: Fuck that. And two more: Enough already. \u2014 \u2014 Adapted from our latest mass-market book, \"It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work.\" The Economist called it \"funny, well-written and iconoclastic and by far the best thing on management published this year.\"", "date": "2021-07-25T00:00:00", "id": "9c4e489f-35a8-4849-b51a-a04843cb8b0a", "author": "jason"}

You\u2019ll do what they say \u2014 often at the detriment of your smaller customers \u2014 because the big companies pay the big bucks. And if you don\u2019t follow their money with your effort, an exodus of just one or two big customers could seriously impact your bottom line. It could put you at major risk. You don't want a customer you can't afford to lose. So instead we take the other approach \u2014 a broad customer base where nearly everyone pays us roughly the same amount per month, all things considered. We don't play favorites. For example, Basecamp is $99/month flat, no matter how many users you have. Have 250 users? Or just 3? It's still just $99/month total. What's that? It's a picture of our business in a random year \u2014 2017, to be specific. Each dot represents the lifetime $billings of a single Basecamp account. See how uniform that is? It looks like static. Static is a healthy business. No outliers, no major splotches. If you removed any one dot \u2014 or even any 10, 20, or 100 dots \u2014 you\u2019d barely notice. You could probably remove 1000 random dots and it would still look the same. You know what else it looks like? Insulation. Because it is insulation \u2014 insulation from risk. Of course we wouldn\u2019t want this to happen, but because our revenue is so equally distributed across a large number of independent customers, if a random 10% of our customers left tomorrow, we\u2019d be a smaller business, but we'd also be predictably ok. We\u2019d never have to cross our fingers and hope that \u201cCustomer X that pays us 100x more than the average customer\u201d wasn\u2019t part of that 10%. If you mapped your customers like this, what would your your chart look like? If you started pulling away your 10 biggest customers, would you see big gaps, or would the holes be swallowed up by the whole? Would it be obvious with a few removed or would you be able to even tell the difference? Are you diversified or dangerously dedicated to a few big bets? Some special customers, or all special customers? We'll take all. -Jason", "date": "2021-06-23T00:00:00", "id": "3ee764fa-07b5-47a9-9f42-2b383c200eef", "author": "jason"}

And, of course, for many, many years after that, just as we've done with Basecamp for more than 17 years. And HEY won't be all we're improving \u2014 Basecamp 4 is on the horizon as well.Designing, building, launching, and supporting HEY was a full-company effort.

We hope HEY has helped you get your email back under control, and, with that, hopefully you've been able to free up some time and attention for more important things in life.Yes, it's the middle of 2021, and an odd time to wish everyone a great year, but it feels like it's a new beginning. Thanks for being part of ours, and we hope we can continue being part of yours. If you haven't tried HEY yet, I'd like to invite you to give it a try.

The place is packed with stuff that can simulate just about any sound you could imagine. The combinations are especially cool \u2014 there's this one part where Sandra, one of the Foley artists, combines a hinge with a fence to produce a much richer, more resonant sound. What a cool skill. Wait, what's a Foley artist? Watch to find out.

I scroll back in time until I find one that's about this same date from 2020 and hit play. And I have the inventory, another 12 months back to 2019. Last year at this time we were smack dab in the middle of COVID, a pivotal political campaign in the US, and a few weeks past the murder of George Floyd. There was much prognostication. As you can imagine, there were a lot of experts on a lot of podcasts in June 2020. There was a lot to talk about. Listening back now, you notice something from before: Experts are confident, but their predictions often miss the mark. They're just like you and me \u2014 they have flawed, biased, human opinions. They reason emotionally. They're informed by their present circumstance, and filled with historical reference, but everything forward looking is a guess. Some guess better than others, but on reflection you hear a lot of false confidence about what's actually happening, what's possible, where things are heading, and what's going to change. I don't listen to hold anything against anyone, or to play gotchya. I had no idea either. I listen as a reminder to be less certain. Less sure. No one really knows in the moment. We should know that.

Their pedigree is exceptional, their portfolio is stocked with amazing work, their experience is vast, they\u2019re a confident interview, and everything just feels perfect. They're obvious. It happens, but that\u2019s not how it usually works. There are very few perfect people. Instead there\u2019s a lot of future perfect people.

Their portfolios are full of mediocre work, but it\u2019s not because they\u2019re mediocre designers. It\u2019s because they\u2019ve been given mediocre opportunities. Sometimes designers are held back by onerous process. Other times they're held back by a client. Other times they're held back by business constraints. Other times their days are fragmented by meetings, and they simply don't have the time to dig into uninterrupted hours of deep creative work. Other times their work is focus-grouped to death. Other times their work is great when delivered, but diluted by future changes out of their control. Other times their most interesting designs are quashed by a management team that's afraid to step outside the mainstream.

The other lives in my pocket. The one on my wrist can tell me the time (precisely in 12 hour format, roughly in 24), the day of the week, the month of the year, which year of the leap year cycle we\u2019re in, and the current moon phase. But that\u2019s its limit. There\u2019s no software, only hardware. It\u2019s programmed in springs and gears and levers and jewels. The one in my pocket can tell me anything and do just about everything. It knows my voice, it responds to my touch, and it even instantly recognizes my face. This machine even knows the angle, velocity, and distance it travels when I swing it around. And it always knows exactly where it is anywhere on the planet. But sometimes I wonder which one is more modern. The one in my pocket can do more, but only for a limited time. And then it can\u2019t do anything. It dies unless it can drink electrons from a wall through a cable straw for some hours every day. And in a few years it\u2019ll be outdated. In ten years it might as well be 100 years old. Is something that ages so fast ever actually modern? And then there\u2019s the machine on my wrist. It\u2019s powered entirely by human movement. No batteries, no cables, no daily dependency on the outside world. As long as I\u2019m running, it\u2019s running. And as long as one person checks it out once a decade, it\u2019ll be working as well in 100 years as it works today. It\u2019s better than modern. It\u2019s forever. As time goes by, my pocket will meet many machines. My wrist might too. But when I look down at the machine on my wrist today, and know that in 50 years my son will be able to look down at his wrist at the same machine ticking away the same way it ticks today.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/active-away-how-about-neither-ed70fd69", "title": "The Calm Company: Basecamp's Approach to Remote Work and Productivity", "content": "As a general rule, nobody at Basecamp really knows where anyone else is at any given moment. Are they working? Dunno. Are they taking a break? Dunno. Are they at lunch? Dunno. Are they picking up their kid from school? Dunno. Don\u2019t care. The vast majority of the time, it just doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is letting people design their own schedule around when they can do their best work. This is not nearly as hard as it sounds. But it does require a shift in mindset. Away from \u201cI have to call Jeff into a meeting *now* to get his take on this new feature idea\u201d to \u201cI\u2019ll write up my feature idea for Jeff to check-out whenever he has some free time, and then, maybe, we can have a chat about it live *later*, if needed. If you\u2019re constantly pulling people into things, then yeah, where they are *right now* matters. But if you prefer to let people consider something fully, and get back to you when *when they\u2019re ready*, then it doesn\u2019t matter where they are right now. We choose the latter. We\u2019ve always worked like this at Basecamp. Since we\u2019ve always been a remote company with people spread out all over the world, we\u2019ve been *forced* to work this way. We learned to appreciate the benefits of working asynchronously quickly as we collaborated over seven time zones right from the start. But it wasn\u2019t until we gave up on Presence that we really got to embrace the complete sense of calm that comes from not caring about when someone is working (or not) or where someone is (or isn\u2019t) at this very moment. Presence is a feature of many modern communication work tools. It\u2019s generally represented by a green, red, or yellow dot. If there\u2019s a green dot next to someone\u2019s name it means they\u2019re available. Yellow or red means they\u2019re away. This is how many companies get a read on who\u2019s working when. For years we used an internal instant messaging system that broadcasted everyone\u2019s real-time status. It seemed cool, it seemed useful. It seemed like something that would be good to know. But it turned out to be TMI: Too Much Information. Because, really, what does \u201cavailable\u201d and \u201caway\u201d really mean? Official definitions don\u2019t matter, because here\u2019s what they *actually* mean: \u201cAvailable to be bothered\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m running away and hiding because I can\u2019t get any fucking work done around here.\u201d Away, in particular, can be seen as bad form. Stay \u201caway\u201d (which most often actually means you\u2019re working, but don\u2019t want to be bothered) and people begin to question if you\u2019re at work at all. Leave \u201caway\u201d on too long and you\u2019re seen as unreliable. If you\u2019ve got presence on your work tools, you\u2019ve probably lived this very thing. What a joke, right? And \u201cavailable\u201d is usually just an invitation to be interrupted. Try being available for 3 hours, and then try being away for 3 hours. Bet you get more work done when you\u2019re marked away. Truth is, there are hardly any good reasons to know if someone\u2019s available or away at any given moment. If you truly need something from someone, ask them. If they respond, then you have what you needed. If they don\u2019t, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re ignoring you \u2014 it\u2019s because they\u2019re busy. Respect that! Assume people are focused on their own work. Are there exceptions? Of course. It might be good to know who\u2019s around in a true emergency, but 1% occasions like that shouldn\u2019t drive policy 99% of the time. And there are times where certain teams need to make sure someone\u2019s around so there are no gaps in customer service coverage, but those are specialized cases best handled by communication, not an ambiguous colored dot next to someone\u2019s name. These days at Basecamp we eschew status, we reject presence, we avoid abstraction. In fact, when designing the latest version of Basecamp, we deliberately decided to keep status and presence out of the product. We had it early on during the design process, but then we turned it off and we never missed it. The moment it was gone, a burden was lifted and things calmed down around here. So take a step towards calm, and relieve people from needing to broadcast their status. They\u2019ve got enough work to do \u2014 managing how they\u2019re presenting their availability to the company at large is an unnecessary burden. Everyone\u2019s status should be implicit: I\u2019m trying to do my job, please respect my time and attention.", "date": "2021-05-19T00:00:00", "id": "8ad4d132-4022-4a7b-ac49-524a770ad5cf", "author": "jason"}

Hear it: [https://lexfridman.com/noam-chomsky/](https://lexfridman.com/noam-chomsky/) Read Something This interview with the reclusive John Swartzwelder is just spectacular, clever, and funny as hell. John was one of the original writers on 'The Simpsons', and the most prolific \u2014 he wrote 59 episodes. When you read the interview, you can see why the show was such a marvel. The story about his application to write for Letterman is also just great. I also loved his thoughts on self-publishing. Amen. So much good stuff in this one.

But one of my favorite bits is the angled emblem on the earliest mid-60s cars. It's just such a charming, quirky touch. Love the angle, but also love the type \u2014 especially how the bottom of the 9 breaks below the baseline. I saw one recently and it caught my eye again.

It's not a rigid thing that exists, it's a flexible, malleable idea that evolves. We aren't stuck with what we have, we can create what we want. Just as we improve products through iteration, we iterate on our company too. Recently, we've made some internal company changes, which, taken in total, collectively feel like a full version change. It deserves an announcement. In the product world, not all changes are enjoyed by all customers. Some changes are immediately appreciated. Some changes take time to steep, settle in, and get acquainted with. And to some, some changes never feel quite right \u2014 they may even be deal breakers. The same is true when changing your company, except that the customers are the employees. And when you get to a certain count \u2014 customers or employees or both \u2014 there's no pleasing everyone. You can't \u2014 there are too many unique perspectives, experiences, and As Huxley offers in Heavy, yes, but insightful, absolutely. A relevant reminder. We make individual choices. We all want different somethings. Some slightly different, some substantially. Companies, however, must settle the collective difference, pick a point, and navigate towards somewhere, lest they get stuck circling nowhere. With that, we wanted to put these directional changes on the public record. Historically we've tried to share as much as we can \u2014 for us, and for you \u2014 so this transmission continues the tradition. This may look like compression. A reduction, an elimination. And it is. It's precisely that. We're compressing X to allow for expansion in Y. A return to whole minds that can focus fully on the work we choose to do. A return to a low-ceremony steady state where we can make decisions and move on. A return to personal responsibility and good faith trust in one another to do our own individual jobs well. A return to why we started the company. A return to what we do best. Who's responsible for these changes? David and I are. Who made the changes? David and I did. These are our calls, and the outcomes and impacts land at our doorstep. Input came from many sources, disagreements were heard, deliberations were had. In the end, we feel like this is the long-term healthy way forward for Basecamp as a whole \u2014 the company and our products. When you've been around 20 years, you've been through change. You're used to it, and comfortable with it. These changes are part of a continuum in the experiment of independence that is Basecamp (and 37signals before that). We'll eventually run headlong into big change again. This is what we've done, and this is what we'll do \u2014 time guarantees it. We're very much looking forward to this new version of the company. Once the construction site is cleaned up, and the dust settles, we believe we'll see a refocused, refreshed, and revitalized Basecamp.

One student asked me what our valuation was. I gave her the honest answer: I haven\u2019t a clue. Today I still don't. How is it possible that a successful software company today doesn\u2019t know what it's worth? A valuation is what other people think your business is worth. I\u2019ve only ever been interested in what our company is worth to us. Startups these days are bantered about as if they were in a fantasy football bracket. So and So raised $150 million at a $2.5 billion valuation? But This and That got tossed another $2.8 billion at a $41.2 billion valuation! Then there are the companies barely off the ground getting VC backing being valued at hundreds of millions \u2014 or even a billion \u2014 despite having no business model. Entrepreneurs by nature are competitive. But fundraising has become the sport in place of the nuts and bolts of building a sustainable business. Entrepreneurs by nature are competitive. But fundraising has become the sport in place of the nuts and bolts of building a sustainable business. The last time I considered Basecamp\u2019s valuation was nearly 15 years ago. At that point, we'd been approached by dozens of VC firms looking to invest. But with a solid product, a growing consumer base, and increasing profitability, we didn\u2019t entertain any offers. Then, in 2006, I got an email from Jeff Bezos\u2019s personal assistant. Jeff wanted to meet. I took the meeting. After a visit to Seattle and a few more calls, Jeff bought a small piece of our company. We didn\u2019t take the cash to turn Basecamp into something \u2014 we took risk off the table so we could keep it the same. In the years since, we\u2019ve been approached by literally hundreds of private investors, VCs, and private equity firms. They want to put money into our company, but we don\u2019t want it. It\u2019s not hubris; it\u2019s the cost that comes with the cash. I want to do what we want, no strings attached, no justification necessary. I want to grow our company according to our timetable, not one dictated by a board. For many startups, funding has worked to their detriment \u2014 unnecessarily raised stakes, a path to unnaturally rapid growth. Venture capital is not free money. Years ago, during the investment discussion with Jeff, we had to place a financial value on our company. The process of constructing a valuation was pretty silly, to be honest. We drew up charts, made some educated guesses, negotiated back and forth, and ultimately came up with a figure. We made it up, as everyone does. Let\u2019s just admit it right now: Financial projections are big, fat guesses. They are best-case scenarios. Since they\u2019re hypothetical, why not pull a number out of a hat? Jeff knows this. All investors know this. Yes, you can look at revenue and profit and multiples, but so many tech company projections these days aren\u2019t based on anything real. They\u2019re based on fantasy. And too often, the more profit you have, the lower your valuation is. Because nothing pops the valuation bubble like reality. My not knowing how much our company is worth doesn\u2019t affect our business on a daily basis. I just don't care to know \u2014 or even care at all. A valuation is an invented number that ebbs and flows on the basis of how much someone else thinks you\u2019re worth.

Like a research paper on a clinical trial, or a picture of Wrigley Field, or a product if you know the name. If you kinda know what you want, and you'll recognize it when you see it, there's a good chance that stodgy old search engine will help you find it. But sometimes you don't need something specific. You want something general. And you don't want to pick through thousands of text or images results to find the best result, when truly any result would do. And you don't want a link to the thing (where you aren't sure what you'll get when you get there), you simply want the thing. In that case, a sea of links is a tax on your time and attention, a moment of choice paralysis you don't need. Variety isn't always the spice of life \u2014 sometimes it's just too salty. For example, what if you just want a joke? Or a compliment? Or a poem? Or a cute animal pic? Not a specific one, just an example of a genre \u2014 and any example will do. I don't need thousands, I need one. And don't make me choose \u2014 you choose for me. Save me some time! Turns out, traditional search engines are kinda bad at that. And getting worse!

You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t. You can\u2019t. I mean you can, but not in spirit of the questions being asked. What people are asking about is *certainty ahead of time*. But time doesn\u2019t start when you start working on something, or when you have a piece of the whole ready. It starts when the whole thing hits the market.How do you know if what you\u2019re doing is right while you\u2019re doing it? You can\u2019t be. You can only have a hunch, a feeling, a belief. And if the only way to tell if you\u2019ve completely missed the mark is to ask other people and wait for them to tell you, then you\u2019re likely too far lost from the start. If you make products, you better have a sense of where you\u2019re heading without having to ask for directions. There\u2019s really only one real way to get as close to certain as possible. That\u2019s to build the actual thing and make it actually available for anyone to try, use, and buy. Real usage on real things on real days during the course of real work is the only way to validate anything. And even then, it\u2019s barely validation since there are so many other variables at play. Timing, marketing, pricing, messaging, etc. Truth is, you don\u2019t know, you won\u2019t know, you\u2019ll never know until you know and reflect back on something real. And the best way to find out, is to believe in it, make it, and put it out there. You do your best, you promote it the best you can, you prepare yourself the best way you know how. And then you literally cross your fingers. I\u2019m not kidding. You can\u2019t validate something that doesn\u2019t exist. You can\u2019t validate an idea. You can\u2019t validate someone\u2019s guess. You can\u2019t validate an abstraction. You can\u2019t validate a sketch, or a wireframe, or an MVP that isn\u2019t the actual product. When I hear MVP, I don\u2019t think Minimum Viable Product. I think Minimum Viable Pie. The food kind. A slice of pie is all you need to evaluate the whole pie. It\u2019s homogenous. But that\u2019s not how products work. Products are a collection of interwoven parts, one dependent on another, one leading to another, one integrating with another. You can\u2019t take a slice a product, ask people how they like it, and deduce they\u2019ll like the *rest*of the product once you\u2019ve completed it. All you learn is that they like or don\u2019t like the slice you gave them.If you want to see if something works, make it. The whole thing. The simplest version of the whole thing \u2013 that\u2019s what version 1.0 is supposed to be. But make that, put it out there, and learn. If you want answers, you have to ask the question, and the question is: Market, what do you think of this completed version 1.0 of our product? Don\u2019t mistake an impression of a piece of your product as a proxy for the whole truth. When you give someone a slice of something that isn\u2019t homogenous, you\u2019re asking them to guess. You can\u2019t base certainty on that. That said, there\u2019s one common way to *uncertainty*: That\u2019s to ask one more person their opinion. It\u2019s easy to think the more opinions you have, the more certain you\u2019ll be, but in practice it\u2019s quite the opposite.

There\u2019s the 1850s version, in which inventor Elisha Otis\u2019s dramatic demonstration of his innovation \u2014 a safety brake that keeps elevators from falling during a cable failure \u2014 set a new bar for colorful, efficient salesmanship. There\u2019s the Hollywood version, in which writers pitching scripts have just 60 seconds to capture the imagination of producers. And then there\u2019s the rumored Jobsian one \u2014 if you worked for Apple and unluckily found yourself standing next to Steve Jobs in an elevator unable to describe your contributions to the company on that brief trip, you might have been sent packing. Today, the virtues of the elevator pitch have been codified by Silicon Valley. Get accepted to a startup accelerator and you\u2019ll be drilled in the art of the two-and-a-half-minute pitch \u2014 because that\u2019s all the time you\u2019ll have to sell your life\u2019s work to a potential investor. That\u2019s fucking ridiculous. The message this sends entrepreneurs is that success depends on your reducing your company\u2019s complex story to a few data points and sound bites. That\u2019s why you so often hear \u201cWe\u2019re the Uber of this\u201d or \u201cthe Warby Parker of that.\u201d Those are shortcuts leaning on people\u2019s preconceived notions of how some business in a different industry defines yours. If you have your own company but require another company to make your point, you\u2019re already headed in the wrong direction. For years, I\u2019ve struggled to come up with my Basecamp elevator pitch \u2014 a succinct description of our product, in standardized, universal terms. But recently I asked myself: Do I actually need one? When you struggle for so long with something, it\u2019s generally a good idea to question the purpose of your struggle. Does it matter anyway? Sure, in theory, the desire for a quick pitch seems reasonable. Who knows whom you might meet and how long you\u2019ll have to make your case? Now, play out some realistic scenarios. When have you ever had to explain your whole business in 20 seconds to someone who was truly motivated to understand what you do? Certainly, there are plenty of times when you are forced to bullet-point your vision to someone who really doesn\u2019t care, like a distant relative or a cab driver. But those who are genuinely curious about your business are willing to listen. It shouldn\u2019t take 10 minutes to explain it, but you don\u2019t need to jam your entire narrative into a couple of quick breaths. The rush of time is a false constraint. For me, context matters. Relying on a one-size-fits-all description of your business means missing an opportunity to engage people rather than just speak at them. Instead of blasting out your script, first show that you\u2019re curious about your audience. Ask them about themselves, what they do, what they struggle with. That\u2019s my approach. If I think Basecamp can be helpful, I define it in their context. I can cherry-pick something they\u2019ve told me and weave Basecamp in as a solution. People get what your company does not because of what you tell them it does, but because of how they see it fitting into their world and how it can benefit them personally. On any given day, I might describe Basecamp a dozen ways. Business owners and project managers have different needs for Basecamp. A freelancer with clients needs something different from someone who just works on internal projects. So ditch the elevator pitch. Taking time to understand someone can be much more powerful than perfecting an overly concise spiel for that mystery person in that mystery elevator.", "date": "2021-03-02T00:00:00", "id": "c11d855d-841a-48db-a9b7-9a7b13de46bd", "author": "jason"}

Snap! Ah, this could work with that, and that feature begets this one. Flows materialize. A name might even be pulled in. Snap! It pulls.

Text on a page, maybe a masthead graphic of some sort. Nothing sophisticated. It often looked like traditional letterhead, or a printed newsletter, but now on the screen. Interactions were few, if any, but perhaps a couple links tied a nascent site together. And there was the other extreme. Highly stylized, lots of textures, 3D-style buttons, page curls, aggressive shadows, monolithic graphics cut up with image maps to allow you to click on different parts of a single graphic, etc. This style was aped from interactive CD/DVD interfaces that came before it. Both of these styles \u2014 the masthead with text, and the heavily graphical \u2014 were *ports*. Not adaptations, but ports. Designs ported from one medium to another. No one knew what to make of the web at that time, so we pulled over things we were familiar with and sunk them in place. At that time, Web design wasn\u2019t web design \u2013 it was print design, multimedia/interactive design, and graphic design. It took years for native web design to come into its own.The web became great when designers started designing *for*the web, not bringing other designs*to*the web.Porting things between platforms is common, especially when the new thing is truly brand new (or trying to gain traction). As the Mac gained steam in the late 80s and early 90s, and Windows 3 came out in 1990, a large numbers of Windows/PC developers began to port their software to the Mac. They didn\u2019t write Mac software, they ported Windows software. And you could tell \u2013 it was pretty shit. It was nice to have at a time when the Mac wasn\u2019t widely developed, but, it was clearly ported. When something\u2019s ported, it\u2019s obvious. Obviously not right. Stuff that\u2019s ported lacks the native sensibilities of the receiving platform. It doesn\u2019t celebrate the advantages, it only meets the lowest possible bar. Everyone knows it. Sometimes we\u2019re simply glad to have it because it\u2019s either that or nothing, but there\u2019s rarely a ringing endorsement of something that\u2019s so obviously moved from A to B without consideration for what makes B, B. What we\u2019re seeing today is history repeat itself. This time we\u2019re not talking about porting software or technology, we\u2019re talking about porting a way to work. In-person office work is a platform. It has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some things are easier in person (meetings, if you\u2019re into those), and some things are harder (getting a few hours to yourself so you can focus, if you\u2019re into that). Remote work is another platform. It has its own unique flavor, advantages, and disadvantages. Its own efficiencies, its own quirks, its own interface. Upsides, downsides, insides, and outsides. It\u2019s as different from in-office work as the Mac is from Windows. Yes, they\u2019re both operating systems, and methods of computing, but they\u2019re miles apart where it matters. The same is true for the difference between in-office work and remote work. Yup, it\u2019s all still the same work, but it\u2019s a different *way*to work.In-office and remote work are different *platforms of work*. And right now, what we\u2019re seeing a lot of companies attempt to port local work methods to working remotely. Normally have four meetings a day in person? Then let\u2019s have those same four meetings, with those same participants, over Zoom instead. It\u2019s a way, but it\u2019s the wrong way.Simulating in-person office work remotely does both approaches a disservice. This is often what happens when change is abrupt. We bring what we know from one to the other. We apply what we\u2019re familiar with to the unfamiliar. But, in time, we recognize that doesn\u2019t work. The enlightened companies coming out of this pandemic will be the ones that figured out [the right way to work remotely](https://basecamp.com/books/remote). They\u2019ll have stopped trying to make remote look like local. They\u2019ll have discovered that remote work means more autonomy, more trust, more uninterrupted stretches of time, smaller teams, more independent, concurrent work (and less dependent, sequenced work).They won\u2019t be the ones that just have their waste-of-time meetings online, they\u2019ll be the ones that lay waste to the meetings. They won\u2019t be the ones that depend on checking in on people constantly throughout the day, they\u2019ll be the ones that give their employees time and space to do their best work. They won\u2019t be the ones that can\u2019t wait to pull everyone back to the office, they\u2019ll be the ones that spot the advantages of optionality, and recognize a wonderful resilience in being able to work from anywhere. And they\u2019ll be the ones that finally realize that there\u2019s nothing magical about the office. It\u2019s just a space where work *can*happen, but not where it*must*happen. Anytime a myth is busted is a good time.Work remotely, don\u2019t port the office. \u2014 \u2014 *Related reading:**The Basecamp Guide to Internal Communication**.* Related tooling:Related tooling: *Basecamp**.*", "date": "2021-02-25T00:00:00", "id": "4700a147-2a0b-4be7-a698-611599bb5abe", "author": "jason"}

And I'm finding it a wonderful microcosm of business \u2014 and life \u2014 itself. Here's what it looks like right now: Foam, tape, shims, and glue \u2014 they're holding the whole thing together. It's the guts, the organs, the cartilage, and the bones to keep things lined up, and upright. On top of this game of Tetris, will float tight tolerances of metal and glass. Clean, crisp, and modern. Just like the brochure and proposal (but for twice the price and three times as long!). Whenever people talk about great companies \u2014 especially the enviable ones \u2014 I always remind them that if you peeled back the shiny brand, the fancy communications, and the slick surface layer, you'd see something similar to the picture above. Most businesses are held together with foam, tape, shims, and glue. Fragile supports, spontaneous structures, and stopgap methods to keep it all running. Scar tissue, unfinished edges, good intentions, legacy policies, and quite a few broken promises. Just enough to permit adequate progress to maintain an illusion of we got this. Plan all you want, we're all still figuring it out as we go. We prop it up, wedge it in, spin it around, feel for the center of gravity, and carefully release our grip while slowly stepping back to see if it balances on its own. This goes for your startup, and companies that have been around forever. Ones clearing nothing, and ones clearing a trillion. Not that there's ultimately anything wrong with that. Foam, tape, shims, and glue work! They're flexible, cheap, adaptable, universal, and do the job. They're the tools of the trade.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/hey-world-b02a6f2e", "title": "Introducing HEY World", "content": "It wasn't for lack of things to say, observations to share, or opinions to float. It was primarily because setting up a personal blog was just too much of a hassle. It felt formal, it required yet another tool, yet another place to write, yet another platform to pay for just one feature. I had to pick a template, I had to think up a name, I had to make the relationship official. I didn't want any of that. I just wanted to write. It's amazing how complicated it remains \u2014 even in 2021 \u2014 just to get your simple thoughts down in text, on the web, at a permanent URL, for anyone in the world to see. Which is why Twitter has primarily been my publishing place of choice. Quick, short, easy. It's outstanding for that. Peerless. But it comes with increasingly undesirable downsides. Newton's Third Law of Motion states that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Twitter's First Law of Tweeting states that for every tweet there's an unequal and opposite overreaction. Post something, and hear how you're wrong a dozen different ways. It's exhausting. I want to write, not fight. But beyond that, I simply want to share more considered, extended essays. Longer-form stuff. Even just a few paragraphs. Tweetstorms are fine \u2014 and they have their place \u2014 but they're really a hack for a multi-paragraph, complete thought on a single page. So I was thinking. Where do I write longer-form, single page stuff most often? When my co-workers are the audience, I always write in Basecamp. But when I want to send something detailed to someone else, anywhere else, it goes in an email. Email is the internet's oldest self-publishing platform. Billions of emails are \"published\" every day. Everyone knows how to do it, and everyone already can. The only limitation is that you have to define a private audience with everything you send. You've gotta write an email to: someone. So I thought, why not expand the possibilities here? Of course still let email be email, but what else could email be? When I write a certain kind of email \u2014 aka a blog post \u2014 why do I have to address it to someone? Why can't I just address my thoughts to the world? Direct to the web for anyone and everyone? Rather than define the recipients, I just write and let the recipients find me. Hmm! That might get me \u2014 and maybe many more \u2014 to (re)discover the joy of simply writing personal thoughts for public consumption. Sometimes you don't have to change the thing itself, but rather just make the thing considerably easier than it's ever been before. That's often the invitation you need to try something new, or jump back in again. So we set out to do it. To test the theory. And over the last few weeks we built it into HEY, our new email service. We're calling the feature HEY World. This post you're reading right now is the world's first HEY World post. And I published it by simply emailing this text directly to world@hey.com from my jason@hey.com account. That was it. For now, this remains an experiment. I've got my own HEY World blog, and David has his. We're going to play for a while. And, if there's demand, we'll roll this out to anyone with a personal @hey.com account. It feels like Web 1.0 again in all the right ways. And it's about time. Speaking of Web 1.0, HEY World pages are lighting fast. No javascript, no tracking, no junk. They're a shoutout to simpler times. Respect. As for me, I've been cataloguing a bunch of thoughts lately, waiting for the day where I could share them this easily. Now that publishing is as simple as sending an email, I plan on writing a lot. And, if you'd like to know when I publish something new, just enter your email address below and you'll get some of my favorites sent direct to you. Let's see how this turns out. Thanks for reading.

There are things I\u2019ve wanted to do, but if I didn\u2019t do them I\u2019d be fine with that too. There are targets that would have been nice to hit, but if I didn\u2019t hit them I wouldn\u2019t look back and say I missed them. I don\u2019t aim for things that way. I do things, I try things, I build things, I want to make progress, I want to make things better for me, my company, my family, my neighborhood, etc. But I\u2019ve never set a goal. It\u2019s just not how I approach things. A goal is something that goes away when you hit it. Once you\u2019ve reached it, it\u2019s gone. You could always set another one, but I just don\u2019t function in steps like that. When you shift from 1st to 2nd, 1st is behind you. Then from 2nd to 3rd, 2nd is behind you. I approach things continuously, not in stops. I just want to keep going \u2014 whatever happens along the way is just what happens. I consider Basecamp, my current business, as one continuous line back from when I sold the first thing I ever remember making \u2014 a logo for $50 (which happened to be for Andrei Heramischuk \u2014 who knew!). I was 16 or something like that at the time. I didn\u2019t have a goal to make two logos, or to be able to charge $5000 for a logo. I just made logos. And then I made software. And then I made web sites. And now I make software again. No goals in the process that I remember.I just worked at whatever I was working on and ended up wherever I am. I continue to approach work and life that same way today. If I\u2019ve used the word goal, I didn\u2019t mean it that way. It was just the word I picked, a synonym for something else. I really like what Jim Coudal said about goals:\u201cThe reason that most of us are unhappy most of the time is that we set our goals not for the person we\u2019re going to be when we reach them, but we set our goals for the person we are when we set them.

Figuring out which things go in which bucket is critical to fully understanding how to make something useful. Shouldn\u2019t everything be obvious? Unless you\u2019re making a product that just does one thing \u2013 like a paperclip, for example \u2013 everything won\u2019t be obvious. You have to make tough calls about what needs to be obvious, what should be easy, and what should be possible. The more things something (a product, a feature, a screen, etc) does, the more calls you have to make. This isn\u2019t the same as prioritizing things. High, medium, low priority doesn\u2019t tell you enough about the problem. \u201cWhat needs to be obvious?\u201d is a better question to ask than \u201cWhat\u2019s high priority?\u201d Further, priority doesn\u2019t tell you anything about cost. And the first thing to internalize is that everything has a cost. Making something obvious has a cost. You can\u2019t make everything obvious because you have limited resources. I\u2019m not talking money\u2014although that may be part of it too. I\u2019m primarily talking screen real estate, attention span, comprehension, etc. Making something obvious is expensive because it often means you have to make a whole bunch of other things less obvious. Obvious dominates and only one thing can truly dominate at a time. It may be worth it to make that one thing completely obvious, but it\u2019s still expensive. Obvious is all about always. The thing(s) people do all the time, the always stuff, should be obvious. The core, the epicenter, the essence of the product should be obvious. Beyond obvious, you\u2019ll find easy. The things that should be easy are the things that people do frequently, but not always. It all depends on your product, and your customer, but when you build a product you should know the difference between the things people do all the time and the things they do often. This can be hard, and will often lead to the most internal debates, but it\u2019s important to think deeply about the difference between always and often so you get this right. And finally are the things that are possible. These are things people do sometimes. Rarely, even. So they don\u2019t need to be front and center, but they need to be possible. Possible is usually the trickiest category because the realistic list of things that should be possible will often be significantly longer than the list of things that should be obvious or easy. That means that some things on the possible list might be better off off the list completely. Instead of making them possible, maybe not making them at all is the right call. Coming to know the difference between obvious, easy, and possible takes a lot of practice, deep thinking, critical analysis, and, often, debate. It\u2019s a constant learning process. It helps you figure out what really matters. But once you\u2019re able to see the buckets clearly, and you begin to think about things in terms of obvious, easy, and possible instead of high, medium, and low priority, you\u2019re on your way to building better products.", "date": "2021-02-22T00:00:00", "id": "da562624-296c-4abe-a690-02df9c1dbc05", "author": "jason"}
{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/give-it-5-minutes-e065a7c7", "title": "Give it Five Minutes", "content": "Years ago I used to be a hothead. Whenever anyone said anything, I\u2019d think of a way to disagree. I\u2019d push back hard if something didn\u2019t fit my world-view. It\u2019s like I had to be first with an opinion \u2013 as if being first meant something. But what it really meant was that I wasn\u2019t thinking hard enough about the problem. The faster you react, the less you think. Not always, but often. It\u2019s easy to talk about knee jerk reactions as if they are things that only other people have. You have them too. If your neighbor isn\u2019t immune, neither are you. This came to a head back in 2007. I was speaking at the Business Innovation Factory conference in Providence, RI. So was Richard Saul Wurman. After my talk Richard came up to introduce himself and compliment my talk. That was very generous of him. He certainly didn\u2019t have to do that. And what did I do? I pushed back at him about the talk he gave. While he was making his points on stage, I was taking an inventory of the things I didn\u2019t agree with. And when presented with an opportunity to speak with him, I quickly pushed back at some of his ideas. I must have seemed like such an asshole. His response changed my life. It was a simple thing. He said \u201cMan, give it five minutes.\u201d I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it\u2019s fine to disagree, it\u2019s fine to push back, it\u2019s great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you\u2019re sure you want to argue against them. \u201cFive minutes\u201d represented \u201cthink\u201d, not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion looking to prove something, not learn something. This was a big moment for me. Richard has spent his career thinking about these problems. He\u2019s given it 30 years. And I gave it just a few minutes. Now, certainly he can be wrong and I could be right, but it\u2019s better to think deeply about something first before being so certain you\u2019re right. There\u2019s also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. Ask more questions. Learning to think first rather than react quick is a life long pursuit. It\u2019s tough. I still get hot sometimes when I shouldn\u2019t. But I\u2019m really enjoying all the benefits of getting better. If you aren\u2019t sure why this is important, think about this quote from Jonathan Ive regarding Steve Jobs\u2019 reverence for ideas: And just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished. That\u2019s deep. Ideas are fragile. They often start powerless. They\u2019re barely there, so easy to ignore or skip or miss. There are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people\u2019s money and 2. Dismissing an idea. Dismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn\u2019t involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That\u2019s easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea. So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it\u2019s too hard or it\u2019s too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.", "date": "2021-02-22T00:00:00", "id": "c29ede9f-c922-4cbf-a80b-32cadad06a9e", "author": "jason"}

The defaults define the experience for everyone out of the box. And, therefore, for most people in perpetuity. Convention over configuration rules the day. To me, everything it could possibly do is less interesting than what it does right now, factory fresh. At 37signals we call this The Golden Path and we discuss it often. If a customer followed our lead, stayed in the grooves, and did exactly as the software suggested, what would that experience be like? That's the one nearly everyone will have, so making it great is our top priority. Certainly some will take the path least traveled. Others will head to whatever gear icon they can find and start turning the dials and pulling the levers. And then there are those who enjoy figuring out how to break things by imagining every exception or edge case, and seeing how the app handles it. It's great to have these customers too! But they aren't the ones that pay the bills. Most buy something they just want to work. Configuration is a drag, not a desire. Setting something up brings them down. They just want their struggle out of the way, and choosing and buying the thing was the majority of the work they signed up for. The rest should just glide. Defaults aren't just about nailing The Golden Path, it's also about choosing one. What experience do we want people to have? What opinions do we want to carve into the product? It's not just what we're trying to do, it's what we're trying to say. So if you really want to know what a company thinks about their product, their customer, and the experience they imagine is the best one, just roll with the stock product. Don't mess with it, use it as is.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/thoughts-on-the-search-for-life-7bb9c6e6", "title": "Random Thoughts on the Origins of Life", "content": "Just listened to Lex Fridman and Sara Walker talk about the origins of life, the search for life, what is life, etc. It was a wonderfully refreshing, nourishing conversation. It made me want to spill out some random thoughts on the subject. I\u2019m unqualified, but I\u2019m curious. Our search for life off this planet is inherently primitive. We search for life based on our definitions, using instruments designed to detect what we already know. And who can blame us? It would be impossible to look for what we wouldn\u2019t recognize in a way that we can\u2019t realize. It wasn\u2019t until the 17th century that we even discovered microbial life. And microbial life is the most plentiful life on earth, far surpassing the biomass of plant, animal, and fungal life combined. There\u2019s more of it than anything, and we\u2019ve always been living among it, yet we didn\u2019t know it was here. But it wasn\u2019t just that. Since we share a common ancestor with microbial life, we didn\u2019t find new life, we found an earlier version of who we were. Imagine a microbe evolving so much intelligence that it forgot where it came from, only to invent instruments billions of years later to find itself again. That\u2019s what happened. How beautiful is that? Maybe it will happen again. If we find life elsewhere, we might be discovering a more advanced version of ourselves. Or if life finds us, it might rediscover its primitive origins. If we can forget and lose our history once, why couldn't we forget and lose our future again? It makes me think about what other forms life could take. And how we might never be able to detect it. Let\u2019s imagine that thoughts were a form of life. They feel like it. They mate, they multiply, they evolve, they consume us, they drive us, they make us move, they seem to be born, they seem to die. They seem to have their own agency, appearing in your mind whether welcome or not. But you can't see thoughts. You don't even know a thought exists until you, or someone else, has it. Maybe thoughts are location-based, waiting in every place. To discover one, you can\u2019t look for it. Rather, you have to be where it is. Imagine what it would be like to stand on Mars, looking back at Earth. But if you were actually there, you\u2019d almost certainly have a thought you couldn\u2019t have here. Insights incompatible with any earthly experience. Questions that couldn\u2019t be contemplated without standing on Martian sand. From Mars, the Earth is mirror. From Earth, Mars is a mirror. Both mirrors, but each perspective reflecting entirely different thoughts. You can\u2019t see the same view or have the same thought from the other place. You must be there to meet thoughts living there. Maybe thoughts don't exist in time and space but in mind and place. This specific mind, in that specific place. Then imagine trying to look for thoughts with our instruments and techniques. Nothing would register. Trillions of thoughts unnoticed, unaware. They can\u2019t be measured, they can only be experienced. How could we ever find them without having them, without being there, without being them? We search for life as if it's something to be found. But perhaps there's something even more alive, beyond our current understanding.", "date": "2024-06-22T00:00:00", "id": "148091fa-854f-4747-abdb-9cff1f5c643b", "author": "jason"}

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/separation-162a4b53", "title": "Developing the Ability to Tease Things Apart", "content": "In my experience, a key skill to develop is the ability to separate one thing from another. To prevent the small from becoming the all. Take a policy, for example. Could be a government, or a school, or a home owner\u2019s association, or something at work. Whatever it is, you don\u2019t like it. You don\u2019t agree, you don\u2019t like the decision maker, you don\u2019t like how it was enacted, pick a reason, it doesn\u2019t matter which. When you don\u2019t like something, there\u2019s a tendency for that one thing to become everything. Now you don\u2019t like the whole government, Or the whole school. Or the whole association. Or the whole company. Or, if it\u2019s a specific problem with a product, then the whole product is a problem. Is it? Or is it you? Not you as in you did the thing, but you dissolving the membranes, turning a complex organism back into a single cell. It\u2019s psychologically simpler to cast an opinion collectively than it is specifically, but in the end, that easy street often leads to a dead end. It\u2019s easy to feel \u201cI\u2019m pissed\u201d, but really, just part of you is pissed. At that same time, another part of you loves your partner, another part of you is excited about the trip you\u2019re about to take, another part of you is nervous awaiting the results of a recent blood draw, another part of you is focused on the current task, another part is hungry for lunch. We contain multitudes, and recognizing that you\u2019re a thousand things rather than your most obvious emotion is a step towards maturity. Take something your friend said recently. You kinda can\u2019t believe they said it. Shocked, even. They\u2019re on that side? They took that take? Ok, let\u2019s say they did. Now, do you let it bleed into everything else you think about them? You could, but I\u2019d suggest that\u2019s your problem, not theirs. What about the other things about them? They\u2019re your friend, after all. You got here somehow, and it wasn\u2019t because of the things you didn\u2019t like about them. There\u2019s a good chance all the good stuff is still the good stuff. The relationship has more depth now. In this context, complexity is a gift. Now replace friend with government or group or company or product or organization. Developing the ability to tease things apart helps you compartmentalize the less desirable from the more desirable, and see the whole map, with all its separate states of like and dislike, favorable and unfavorable. There\u2019s a very good chance that when you do that, you\u2019ll like a lot more than you despise. Kids know this, then it seems they \u2014 we \u2014 forget it. Kids like their food separated. Don\u2019t let the blueberries touch \u2014 CONTAMINATE! \u2014 the chips. Don\u2019t let the carrots graze the sandwich. Don\u2019t let the cookies touch the cheese. This way they can HATE the carrots, but love their lunch. In an absurd way, it seems like the healthy approach. Separate. Distinguish. Decouple. Isolate. Differentiate. One thing\u2019s rarely everything, unless you make it so. -Jason -Jason", "date": "2024-05-10T00:00:00", "id": "abe7a404-4cf7-4afc-be60-da0e1809ca00", "author": "jason"}

It ain\u2019t the money, as I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to make more than I\u2019ll ever be able to spend. I enjoy the work and we have a great crew, each a true pleasure to work with. I remain filled with ideas. So that\u2019s part of it. But it\u2019s more that than. It\u2019s more of a justice thing, really. Look at this screenshot. This is software my neighborhood uses to manage guest parking passes. It\u2019s shit. Maybe you recognize it, maybe you don\u2019t, but the name doesn\u2019t matter. You know what the company charges for the privilege of using it? $10,000/year. $10,000 A YEAR! $10,000 year after year of our HOA budget goes to this crap. It feels borderline criminal. I\u2019m still doing this because the world is flooded with overpriced, crappy, subpar software. It hurts people and it hurts the economy. I feel a moral obligation to do what I can to replace bad options with great options, at vastly reduced prices. I even want to replace great options with equally great options, just at reduced prices. Good software should not be expensive. Software is an absolute miracle. You can make exceptionally good stuff at exceptionally reasonable prices. It\u2019s not like hardware manufacturing where you have to cut all sorts of corners to keep costs in check, or charge a ton for stuff that\u2019s truly well made. Raw materials, machinery, manufacturing, tight tolerances, physics \u2014 this stuff costs a lot to get right. Software does not. Yet bad \u2014 and great software, frankly \u2014 remains way over priced. And some is absolute highway robbery. Like this parking pass software. It\u2019s clear no one cared about it \u2014 it\u2019s just built to some spec by people who will never use it. It\u2019s all there, the features tick the boxes, and technically it works, but we\u2019d never ever find it acceptable if it was a physical product. But since it\u2019s software, it can suck and we can still be sold on a $10,000/year contract. This fuels me. So hell yeah I\u2019m motivated. And the more bad stuff I bump into, or even great stuff with silly numbers attached, the more motivated I get. It\u2019s a deep well that keeps on providing. To that end, we\u2019ve just started working on two more new products this year. We\u2019re on a tear. We\u2019re going to keep on putting quality stuff out there at reasonable prices. Not just to prove that it can be done, but because it must be done. -Jason About Jason Fried Hey! I'm Jason, the Co-Founder and CEO at 37signals, makers of Basecamp and HEY.

And it should start on day one, class one, and go at least as long as the course allows. The businesses that are started, and the struggles and successes that ensue, should be the subject matter, period. Instead, there\u2019s a lot of talk. There\u2019s a lot of abstraction. There\u2019s a lot of strategizing. There\u2019s a lot of business plan writing. There\u2019s a lot of game play. There\u2019s a lot of theorizing. And there are plenty of case studies. But there\u2019s very little guitar being played, clay being formed, and balls being hit. Imagine learning guitar by planning how you\u2019re going to play. Or learning how to throw a pot on a wheel by presenting a Powerpoint on it. Or learning how to keep the ball in the lines by studying how the lines were painted. We\u2019d roll our eyes. And rightfully so. Yet this is how entrepreneurship is taught. Heads should roll. And rightfully so. Give me two people \u2014 Person A has spent two years in business school studying how to start a business that doesn\u2019t yet exist. Person B has never set foot in business school, but has been running their own business for two years. Who\u2019s learned more about entrepreneurship along the way? Who has the advantage in year three? I know who I\u2019m picking. You? To learn business, do business. -Jason", "date": "2024-02-27T00:00:00", "id": "d694a469-f897-4320-8cb7-6a0534dc8b17", "author": "jason"}

And I hate the question. It's usually framed in a way that encourages you to pretend to place yourself in the nascent days of your career, or early adulthood. Back when you didn't know much, when you were trying to figure things out. Essentially it's asking you which mistakes you wish you didn't make. To squint and identify the things you could have bypassed if you were armed with the wisdom of hindsight. My take? I think you\u2019d have made the same mistakes, and I don\u2019t think you could have avoided anything that happened. Why? First, it assumes you'd even listen to your 50 year old self when you were 20. Next it assumes you'd even be ready and able to accept the advice you didn't recognize as relevant. Last it assumes you'd be able to avoid the things you didn't see coming. I don't think you could, would, or should. Learning is experiencing and doing. It\u2019s not dodging, following, or forgoing. You had to go through the shit to learn the shit. Sidestepping it would have just landed you in some other shit. And then you'd have wished you had listened to different advice. You wouldn\u2019t have your sage advice today if you hadn\u2019t had the stupid experiences then! In fact, answering the question would erase present you from existence. Because if you were different then, you wouldn\u2019t be the you you know now. Are there mistakes I wish I hadn\u2019t made? One one hand, absolutely \u2014 plenty \u2014 but on the other hand, I had to make them to be who I am now. There\u2019s no version of me that\u2019s present me today with a different set of events in the past.

Nothing more, nothing less, but right there in the pocket. It's almost fractal. It's there in every component, in every feature, in every flow, in every sequence, in every product, in every decision, inside everything across the company. How do you know when it's just right? It's the same feeling you get when you try to balance something physical. You know it. You put something on something else and try to find that center of gravity... A bit to the right, oops too much. Lean back to the left... Steady... Steady... Ugh, too much push. Stack it up again, find that center... Wobble, bobble, almost... And then it locks in. Da! There it is. All the sudden the pushing and pulling forces disappear and it's just there, on its own. Still, in harmony and equanimity. That's what just right feels like. It's easy to experience physically because our bodies speak the language. We feel the weight, we intuit the momentum. Our internal gyroscopes sense balance, and transfers it into objects we touch. But when it comes to intellectual, conceptual things like business or software, we have to shift into the imagined sense of balance. We don't get the free borders, edges, weights, shapes, and gravity, to help us find that middle. Muscles don't pull on tendons don't pull on bones. Our nerves don't get the signals for free. So I imagine. If this was physical, would it balance? I literally think about the center of gravity of an idea, a feature, a button, an idea, a product. Is there too much weight over here? Too much over there? If this whole thing was in stone, would it crash to one side? Or would it stand a chance of staying upright? Would it be at rest, or would it want to fall? Once you find that spot \u2014 the right set of features, the right flows, the right yesses and the right no's, you stop. That's v1. Once you find the balance, you aim to stay in balance. Adding more, but in a balanced way to maintain the form, to keep the center. To hold steady. It's a beautiful thing. That's how I think about making products. -Jason", "date": "2024-02-05T00:00:00", "id": "f1c4074f-461e-414b-ba4a-6aee8bbe1a4e", "author": "jason"}

And social media hadn't even been invented yet, so where else was I supposed to put it? In fact, guess what else happened to launch the same day as Basecamp? Facebook. So we're talking the stone age. I was announcing this new thing we built called We figured if we needed it, plenty of others probably did too. And it turns out they did! We were right. Not only was Basecamp something entirely new at the time, the distribution model, and business model, were new too. We weren't the first to offer software as a subscription service, but we were very, very early. So early in fact that the bank wouldn't allow us to accept annual payments on credit cards because they didn't want to be on the hook if this new software as a subscription service model thing didn't work out in a few months. That's why we could only initially bill monthly! Which turned out to be a pretty good thing in the end. You never know what's going to happen until after it happens. And happen it did. We had this idea that, I don't know, if we could maybe make $5,000 a month after the first year, we'd be on to something. That would be a nice $60,000/year business, which we'd feather into our web design business. We'd essentially treat it as a perpetual client \u2014 we being our own client. Turns out that we hit that $5000/month mark in a few weeks. And a year or so later, Basecamp was generating more revenue for us than our web design business. So we shut that part of the business down and went all-in on Basecamp. And software in general. So much came from Basecamp. And so much still does. Rails came from Basecamp. And tens of thousands of programming careers came from Rails. Other businesses sprang up. Software as a service was further legitimized. And the cycle that began back in the early 2000s continues to spin strongly today. It's been the professional honor of a lifetime to be able to build something that matters to so many, and to build that thing alongside so many extraordinary people, for so many extraordinary people. From co-workers to customers to fellow business owners, and everyone I've met along the way, what an incredible ride it's been so far. And today's Basecamp is the best it's ever been, by far. It's a thrill to watch whole new generation of entrepreneurs, product teams, and small businesses are discovering the secret so many have known: As 2024 marks 20 years of Basecamp, it also marks 25 years of When you've been around an industry long enough, you get to see how cyclical everything is. The Earth is round, and so are trends. When you're close to something, it looks like it's on a straight line forever, but when you step back, and wait awhile, you'll often see it crest the curve, bend out of view, and eventually sneak back up on you from behind. Oh, that again! I remember that. Yeah, that was good. One of the real treats of a long career is to revisit the past and pull some of those better ideas ahead into the present. Right now it feels like we've got a bag of bright ideas slung over our shoulder. And we're headed out for new horizons. I feel so fortunate, and so grateful.

{"url": "https://world.hey.com/jason/cars-and-business-eea60b8d", "title": "Analog vs Digital: A Comparison", "content": "I\u2019m going to draw a parallel that isn\u2019t quite straight, but it\u2019s close enough. It\u2019s between old (analog) cars and new (digital) cars, simple (analog) businesses and complicated (digital) businesses. Lately I\u2019ve been driving two distinctly different cars. One from 1970, and the other from 2023. They essentially have nothing in common other than that you sit in them, they have four tires that contact the road, and you control them with a steering wheel and pedals. Some who don\u2019t care much for cars might say that\u2019s everything in common. On paper I can see the argument, but get behind the wheel of both, and go for a drive, and you wouldn\u2019t say the experiences were equivalent. They\u2019re as different as different can be. The 1970s experience is analog. Your leg strength determines your stopping power. The road surface below clearly communicates with your ass. The steering wheel actually feels like it\u2019s turning the wheels. The windows roll down by turning a crank that literally rolls them down. Switches snick, dials click. This is a direct experience, with mechanical feedback, requiring full attention and real effort. The 2023 experience is digital. Nearly everything is abstracted. The brakes are heavily mechanically assisted. Steering even more so. You can\u2019t really feel the road surface because the suspension masterfully absorbs every little detail. Even the buttons have been replaced by touchscreens with haptics. This is an indirect experience, with simulated feedback, requiring some attention and little effort. Which you prefer is up to you. I happen to love both for different reasons. And that\u2019s just driving. The gulf is wider when it comes to repair. With an old analog car, a problem\u2019s cause is more obvious. Linkages are visible, this connects to that, teeth mesh to move gears which move shafts which move wheels. When something\u2019s broken it\u2019s generally confirmable with a common tool and a set of eyeballs. Any mechanic with a basic understanding can diagnose any problem relatively easily \u2014 sometime solely by ear. There are only so many things it could be, and they\u2019re all right in front of you. With a modern new car, computers enter the picture. Engines are covered, sometimes even inaccessible. Cars crash, but so does firmware. This doesn\u2019t turn that, this sends electrons to that, which are then interpreted by circuits and software and systems. Which one\u2019s to blame when something doesn\u2019t work? It\u2019ll take a while to find out, and at least $1000. Almost anything can be wrong, and you\u2019ll have to leave the car at the shop for a while so they can plug it in and run diagnostics. The human defers to the machine to tell us. Pros and cons for sure. Now for the parallels to business. Through this car experience lens, I\u2019ve come to see businesses as either analog or digital too. I\u2019m not describing their product or what they make. I\u2019m talking about how they\u2019re structured, how they run. An analog business can make software, and a digital business can make pizza. An analog business is direct. It\u2019s clear what does what, and how it does it. When something changes, you typically know what changed. There\u2019s some suspension to absorb the bumps, but it\u2019s basic \u2014 you\u2019re never too far removed from the root cause. There are fewer managers and more doers. There\u2019s less distance between the customer and the maker. Feedback is heard, not interpreted and translated. No decks, just conversations and writing. A digital business is indirect and abstracted. The structure is obscured, riddled with departments and groups run by other groups. Decisions are complicated because one too many people are involved. What should be simple has become complex \u2014 the result of process that serves the prospect, not the purpose. Everything is padded. Getting to someone requires going through something. Customers are a concept, sliced by demographics. Everything\u2019s a presentation rather than a conversation. As usual, the analogies and metaphors don\u2019t map perfectly, but hopefully you feel what I\u2019m getting at. Does it resonate? I aim to run an analog business. Direct, clear, obvious, fair, and easy to fix. -Jason", "date": "2023-12-27T00:00:00", "id": "1f27e323-e590-46a2-ba57-17306cd488f0", "author": "jason"}

Eventually, many options appear that are essentially mostly the same. Now we've got something that quacks like a commodity. Once we've got a commodity, generics eventually follow. Devoid of fancy packaging, marketing, and advertising, prices fall while quality remains perfectly acceptable. Brand name products might be slightly better on some dimensions, but it ultimately becomes a value judgement. A few bucks difference? The confidence of buying a brand name still feels worth it. Many, many bucks different? Maybe not. This happens in most industries. Maybe not in airplanes, but absolutely in peanut butter. And you know what's closer to peanut butter than airplanes? Software is. Strangely, many software categories have commoditized, but, given that nearly everything is a service these days, operational costs have remained universally high. This makes it hard for lower priced generics to creep in. This means people continue to pay luxury prices for software services that are essentially commodities. We think something's wrong with that. Sounds like an opportunity. This is where ONCE comes in. One facet of our initial strategy with ONCE is to find those commoditized pay-forever services everyone's running, and make our own radically simplified '80/20' versions as pay-once products. And this time you get to own for less, not rent for more. And you'll get the code, too. In about a month we'll unveil the first ONCE product.
